> Note: The outlier for test #3 is the event batch that contains the Gateway. It took ~13s to process.

## NumResources to Total Resources

| NumResources | Gateways | Secrets | ReferenceGrants | Namespaces | application Pods | application Services | HTTPRoutes | Attached HTTPRoutes | Total Resources |
|--------------|----------|---------|-----------------|------------|------------------|----------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| x            | 1        | 1       | 1               | x+1        | 2x               | 2x                   | 3x         | 2x                  | <total>         |

> Note: Only 2x HTTPRoutes attach to the Gateway because the parentRef name in the `cafe-tls-redirect` HTTPRoute is incorrect. This will be fixed in the next release.

## Observations

1. The following issues still exist:

   - https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/issues/1124
   - https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/issues/1123

2. All NGINX reloads were in the <= 500ms bucket. An increase in the reload time based on number of configured resources resulting in NGINX configuration changes was observed.

3. No errors (NGF or NGINX) were observed in any test run.

4. The majority of the event batches were processed in 500ms or less except the 3rd test. In the 3rd test, we create the Gateway resource after all the apps and routes. The batch that contains the Gateway is the only one that takes longer than 500ms. It takes ~13s.

## Future Improvements

1. Fix the parentRef name in the `cafe-tls-redirect` [HTTPRoute](/tests/reconfig/scripts/cafe-routes.yaml), so it matches the deployed Gateway.
