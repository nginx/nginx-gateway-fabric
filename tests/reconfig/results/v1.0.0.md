## Observations

1. We are reloading after reconciling a ReferenceGrant even when there is no Gateway. This is because we treat every
   upsert/delete of a ReferenceGrant as a change. This means we will regenerate nginx config every time a ReferenceGrant
   is created, updated (generation must change), or deleted, even if it does not apply to the accepted Gateway.

2. We are reloading after reconciling a HTTPRoute even when there is no accepted Gateway and no config being generated.

3. All reloads were in the <500ms bucket. A slight increase in the reload time based on number of configured resources
   resulting in NGINX configuration changes was observed.

4. No errors (NGF or NGINX) were observed in any test run.
