# System Testing

The tests in this directory are meant to be run on a live Kubernetes environment to verify a real system. These
are similar to the existing [conformance tests](../conformance/README.md), but will verify things such as:

- NGF-specific functionality
- Non-Functional requirements testing (such as performance, scale, etc.)

When running, the tests create a port-forward from your NGF Pod to localhost using a port chosen by the
test framework. Traffic is sent over this port.

Directory structure is as follows:

- `framework`: contains utility functions for running the tests
- `suite`: contains the test files

**Note**: Existing NFR tests will be migrated into this testing `suite` and results stored in a `results` directory.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster.
- Docker.
- Golang.

**Note**: all commands in steps below are executed from the `tests` directory

```shell
make
```

```text
build-images                   Build NGF and NGINX images
create-kind-cluster            Create a kind cluster
delete-kind-cluster            Delete kind cluster
help                           Display this help
load-images                    Load NGF and NGINX images on configured kind cluster
test                           Run the system tests against your default k8s cluster
```

**Note:** The following variables are configurable when running the below `make` commands:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| TAG      | edge    | tag for the locally built NGF images |
| PREFIX   | nginx-gateway-fabric | prefix for the locally built NGF image |
| NGINX_PREFIX | nginx-gateway-fabric/nginx | prefix for the locally built NGINX image |
| PULL_POLICY | Never | NGF image pull policy |
| GW_API_VERSION | 1.0.0 | version of Gateway API resources to install |
| K8S_VERSION | latest | version of k8s that the tests are run on |

## Step 1 - Create a Kubernetes cluster

This can be done in a cloud provider of choice, or locally using `kind`:

```makefile
make create-kind-cluster
```

> Note: The default kind cluster deployed is the latest available version. You can specify a different version by
> defining the kind image to use through the KIND_IMAGE variable, e.g.

```makefile
make create-kind-cluster KIND_IMAGE=kindest/node:v1.27.3
```

## Step 2 - Build and Load Images

Loading the images only applies to a `kind` cluster. If using a cloud provider, you will need to tag and push
your images to a registry that is accessible from that cloud provider.

```makefile
make build-images load-images TAG=$(whoami)
```

## Step 3 - Run the tests

```makefile
make test TAG=$(whoami)
```

To run a specific test, you can "focus" it by adding the `F` prefix to the name. For example:

```go
It("runs some test", func(){
    ...
})
```

becomes:

```go
FIt("runs some test", func(){
    ...
})
```

This can also be done at higher levels like `Context`.

To disable a specific test, add the `X` prefix to it, similar to the previous example:

```go
It("runs some test", func(){
    ...
})
```

becomes:

```go
XIt("runs some test", func(){
    ...
})
```

## Step 4 - Delete kind cluster

```makefile
make delete-kind-cluster
```
