# System Testing

The tests in this directory are meant to be run on a live Kubernetes environment to verify a real system. These
are similar to the existing [conformance tests](../conformance/README.md), but will verify things such as:

- NGF-specific functionality
- Non-Functional requirements (NFR) testing (such as performance, scale, etc.)

When running locally, the tests create a port-forward from your NGF Pod to localhost using a port chosen by the
test framework. Traffic is sent over this port. If running on a GCP VM targeting a GKE cluster, the tests will create an
internal LoadBalancer service which will receive the test traffic.

**Important**: NFR tests can only be run on a GKE cluster.

Directory structure is as follows:

- `framework`: contains utility functions for running the tests
- `results`: contains the results files for the NFR tests
- `scripts`: contain scripts used to set up the environment and run the tests
- `suite`: contains the test files

> Note: Existing NFR tests will be migrated into this testing `suite` and results stored in the `results` directory.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster.
- Docker.
- Golang.

If running NFR tests, or running functional tests in GKE:

- The [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- A GKE cluster (if `master-authorized-networks` is enabled, please set `ADD_VM_IP_AUTH_NETWORKS=true` in your vars.env file)
- Access to GCP Service Account with Kubernetes admin permissions

## Step 1 - Create a Kubernetes cluster

This can be done in a cloud provider of choice, or locally using `kind`.

**Important**: NFR tests can only be run on a GKE cluster.

To create a local `kind` cluster:

```makefile
make create-kind-cluster
```

> Note: The default kind cluster deployed is the latest available version. You can specify a different version by
> defining the kind image to use through the KIND_IMAGE variable, e.g.

```makefile
make create-kind-cluster KIND_IMAGE=kindest/node:v1.27.3
```

To create a GKE cluster:

Before running the below `make` command, copy the `scripts/vars.env-example` file to `scripts/vars.env` and populate the
required env vars. `GKE_SVC_ACCOUNT` needs to be the name of a service account that has Kubernetes admin permissions,
and `GKE_NODES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` needs to be the name of a service account that has `Artifact Registry Reader`,
`Kubernetes Engine Node Service Account` and `Monitoring Viewer` permissions.

```makefile
make create-gke-cluster
```

> Note: The GKE cluster is created with `master-authorized-networks`, meaning only IPs from explicitly allowed CIDR ranges
> will be able to access the cluster. The script will automatically add your current IP to the authorized list, but if
> your IP changes, you can add your new local IP to the `master-authorized-networks` of the cluster by running the
> following:

```makefile
make add-local-ip-to-cluster
```

## Step 2 - Build and Load Images

Loading the images only applies to a `kind` cluster. If using a cloud provider, you will need to tag and push
your images to a registry that is accessible from that cloud provider.

```makefile
make build-images load-images TAG=$(whoami)
```

Or, to build NGF with NGINX Plus enabled (NGINX Plus cert and key must exist in the root of the repo):

```makefile
make build-images-with-plus load-images-with-plus TAG=$(whoami)
```

## Step 3 - Run the tests

### 3a - Run the functional tests locally

```makefile
make test TAG=$(whoami)
```

Or, to run the tests with NGINX Plus enabled:

```makefile
make test TAG=$(whoami) PLUS_ENABLED=true
```

### 3b - Run the tests on a GKE cluster from a GCP VM

This step only applies if you are running the NFR tests, or would like to run the functional tests on a GKE cluster from a GCP based VM.

Before running the below `make` commands, copy the `scripts/vars.env-example` file to `scripts/vars.env` and populate the
required env vars. `GKE_SVC_ACCOUNT` needs to be the name of a service account that has Kubernetes admin permissions.

In order to run the tests in GCP, you need a few things:

- GKE router to allow egress traffic (used by upgrade tests for pulling images from Github)
  - this assumes that your GKE cluster is using private nodes. If using public nodes, you don't need this.
- GCP VM and firewall rule to send ingress traffic to GKE

To just set up the VM with no router (this will not run the tests):

```makefile
make create-and-setup-vm
```

Otherwise, you can set up the VM, router, and run the tests with a single command. See the options in the sections below.

By default, the tests run using the version of NGF that was `git cloned` during the setup. If you want to make
incremental changes and copy your local changes to the VM to test, you can run

```makefile
make sync-files-to-vm
```

#### Functional Tests

To set up the GCP environment with the router and VM and then run the tests, run the following command:

```makefile
make setup-gcp-and-run-tests
```

To use an existing VM to run the tests, run the following

```makefile
make run-tests-on-vm
```

#### NFR tests

To set up the GCP environment with the router and VM and then run the tests, run the following command:


```makefile
make setup-gcp-and-run-nfr-tests
```

To use an existing VM to run the tests, run the following

```makefile
make nfr-test
```

##### Longevity testing

This test is run on its own (and also not in a pipeline) due to its long-running nature. It will run for 4 days before
the tester must collect the results and complete the test.

To start the longevity test, set up your VM (`create-and-setup-vm`) and run

```makefile
make start-longevity-test
```

<!--  -->
> Note: If you want to change the time period for which the test runs, update the `wrk` commands in `suite/scripts/longevity-wrk.sh` to the time period you want, and run `make sync-files-to-vm`.

<!--  -->
> Note: If you want to re-run the longevity test, you need to clear out the `cafe.example.com` entry from the `/etc/hosts` file on your VM.

You can verify the test is working by checking nginx logs to see traffic flow, and check that the cronjob is running and redeploying apps.

After 4 days (96h), you can complete the longevity tests and collect results. To ensure that the traffic has stopped flowing, you can ssh to the VM using `gcloud compute ssh` and run `ps aux | grep wrk` to verify the `wrk` commands are no longer running. Then, visit the [GCP Monitoring Dashboards](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards) page and select the `NGF Longevity Test` dashboard. Take PNG screenshots of each chart for the time period in which your test ran, and save those to be added to the results file.

Finally, run

```makefile
make stop-longevity-test
```

This will tear down the test and collect results into a file, where you can add the PNGs of the dashboard.

### Common test amendments

To run all tests with the label "my-label", use the GINKGO_LABEL variable:

```makefile
make test TAG=$(whoami) GINKGO_LABEL=my-label
```

or to pass a specific flag, e.g. run a specific test, use the GINKGO_FLAGS variable:

```makefile
make test TAG=$(whoami) GINKGO_FLAGS='-ginkgo.focus "writes the system info to a results file"'
```

> Note: if filtering on NFR tests (or functional tests on GKE), set the filter in the appropriate field in your `vars.env` file.

If you are running the tests in GCP, add your required label/ flags to `scripts/var.env`.

You can also modify the tests code for a similar outcome. To run a specific test, you can "focus" it by adding the `F`
prefix to the name. For example:

```go
It("runs some test", func(){
    ...
})
```

becomes:

```go
FIt("runs some test", func(){
    ...
})
```

This can also be done at higher levels like `Context`.

To disable a specific test, add the `X` prefix to it, similar to the previous example:

```go
It("runs some test", func(){
    ...
})
```

becomes:

```go
XIt("runs some test", func(){
    ...
})
```

## Step 4 - Cleanup

1. Delete kind cluster, if required

    ```makefile
    make delete-kind-cluster
    ```

2. Delete the GCP components (GKE cluster, GKE router, VM, and firewall rule), if required

    ```makefile
    make cleanup-gcp
    ```

    or

    ```makefile
    make cleanup-router
    ```

    ```makefile
    make cleanup-vm
    ```

    ```makefile
    make delete-gke-cluster
    ```
