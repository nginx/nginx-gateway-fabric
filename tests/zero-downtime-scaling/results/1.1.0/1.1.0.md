## Summary

Results are similar with 1.0.0 test results. Did not encounter instances of
NGF Pod readiness flagging under high load. Downtime and small errors/warnings still persisted.

Added new Issue to investigate intervals of missing data in the gradual scaling up sections.

## Future Improvements

1. When applying the 10/25node values manifest, try with a larger sleep value and termination grace period to see
   if a bigger value of the delay can prevent traffic loss when scaling down. It could be that the chosen delay
   is not large enough to allow the fronting load balancer to gracefully drain the node with the terminating pod.
