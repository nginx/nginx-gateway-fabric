## Summary:

- Average latency increased across all tests
- Largest Increase: Header-based routing (+76.461µs, +8.60%)
- Smallest Increase: Path-based routing (+28.988µs, +3.26%)
- Average Overall Increase: ~51.1µs (+5.69% average across all tests)
- Most Impacted: Header and query-based routing (8.60% and 5.91% respectively)
- Method Routing: GET and POST both increased by ~5.3%
- All tests maintained 100% success rate, similar throughput and similar max latencies
