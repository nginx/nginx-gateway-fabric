- Commit: f06b10da4a1754e253a58a31d2eff1bd404e33cd
- Date: 2025-06-02T15:20:05Z
- Dirty: false

GKE Cluster:

- Node count: 12
- k8s version: v1.32.4-gke.1106006
- vCPUs per node: 16
- RAM per node: 65851340Ki
- Max pods per node: 110
- Zone: us-west1-b
- Instance Type: n2d-standard-16

## Summary:

- Increased latency in requests.
- Quite a few 502 errors, could be due to load balancer issues for this test run.

## One NGINX Pod runs per node Test Results
