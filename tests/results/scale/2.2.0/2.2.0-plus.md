## Summary:

- Compared with 2.1.0, 2.2.0 achieves near-perfect reliability in scale tests (eliminating 348 errors) but at the cost of notably higher request latency, particularly in the HTTP matching tests where latency increased by approximately 300µs on average.
- 333 total NGINX errors eliminated across listener tests
- 15 NGF errors eliminated (21 → 6 total)
- Listener processing 5-6x faster with far fewer errors
- Clean test results for most tests (zero errors)
- 30-44% increase in HTTP match latency - much more pronounced than OSS (which saw 2-8% increases)
- Processing time increases for HTTPRoutes and UpstreamServers tests
