- Commit: f06b10da4a1754e253a58a31d2eff1bd404e33cd
- Date: 2025-06-02T15:20:05Z
- Dirty: false

GKE Cluster:

- Node count: 12
- k8s version: v1.32.4-gke.1106006
- vCPUs per node: 16
- RAM per node: 65851340Ki
- Max pods per node: 110
- Zone: us-west1-b
- Instance Type: n2d-standard-16

## Summary:

- Expectations of the test suite have changed a bit due to the new architecture.
- Multiple errors in the contol plane relating to updating Gateway status after it has been modified, also seen in previous releases.
- Even more "no live upstream" logs than previously.
- Memory usage has increased (likely due to Agent).
- Latency decreased.
