## Summary:

- Expectations of the test suite have changed a bit due to the new architecture.
- Time to ready generally increases due to provisioning NGINX.
- Seeing some jumbled configuration issues, this has been brought to the attention of the NGINX Agent team.

## Test 1: Resources exist before startup - NumResources 30

### Time to Ready

Time To Ready Description: From when NGF starts to when the NGINX configuration is fully configured
- TimeToReadyTotal: 15s
