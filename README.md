# NGINX Gateway Fabric

NGINX Gateway Fabric is an open-source project that provides an implementation of
the [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) using [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) as the data plane. The goal of
this project is to implement the core Gateway APIs -- `Gateway`, `GatewayClass`, `HTTPRoute`, `GRPCRoute`, `TCPRoute`, `TLSRoute`,
and `UDPRoute` -- to configure an HTTP or TCP/UDP load balancer, reverse-proxy, or API gateway for applications running
on Kubernetes.

For a list of supported Gateway API resources and features, see
the [Gateway API Compatibility](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/overview/gateway-api-compatibility/) doc.

Learn about our [design principles](/docs/developer/design-principles.md) and [architecture](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/overview/gateway-architecture/).

NGINX Gateway Fabric uses [NGINX Agent](https://github.com/nginx/agent) to configure NGINX.

## Getting Started

1. [Get started using a kind cluster](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/get-started/).
2. [Install](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/install/) NGINX Gateway Fabric.
3. Deploy various [examples](examples).
4. Follow instructions for common use cases such as [routing](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/traffic-management/) and [securing](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/traffic-security/) traffic, or [monitoring](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric//monitoring/) your cluster.

You can find the comprehensive NGINX Gateway Fabric user documentation on the [NGINX Documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/) website.

## NGINX Gateway Fabric Releases

We publish NGINX Gateway Fabric releases on GitHub. See
our [releases page](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/releases).

The latest release is [2.2.0](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/releases/tag/v2.2.0).

The edge version is useful for experimenting with new features that are not yet published in a release. To use, choose
the _edge_ version built from the [latest commit](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/commits/main)
from the main branch.

The table below summarizes the options regarding the images, manifests, documentation and examples and gives your links
to the correct versions:

### Versioning

NGF uses semantic versioning for its releases. For more information, see https://semver.org.

> Major version zero `(0.Y.Z)` is reserved for development, anything MAY change at any time. The public API is not stable.

### Release Planning and Development

The features that will go into the next release are reflected in the
corresponding [milestone](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/milestones). Refer to
the [Issue Lifecycle](ISSUE_LIFECYCLE.md) document for information on issue creation and assignment to releases.

## SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

We generate SBOMs for the binaries and the Docker image.

### Binaries

The SBOMs for the binaries are available in the releases page. The SBOMs are generated
using [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) and are available in SPDX format.

### Docker Images

The SBOM for the Docker image is available in
the [GitHub Container](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pkgs/container/nginx-gateway-fabric)
repository. The SBOM is generated using [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) and stored as an attestation in the
image manifest.

For example to retrieve the SBOM for `linux/amd64` and analyze it using [grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) you
can run the following command:

```shell
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric:edge --format '{{ json (index .SBOM "linux/amd64").SPDX }}' | grype
```
