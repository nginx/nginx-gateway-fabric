# NGINX Gateway Fabric

NGINX Gateway Fabric is an open-source project that provides an implementation of
the [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) using [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) as the data plane. The goal of
this project is to implement the core Gateway APIs -- `Gateway`, `GatewayClass`, `HTTPRoute`, `TCPRoute`, `TLSRoute`,
and `UDPRoute` -- to configure an HTTP or TCP/UDP load balancer, reverse-proxy, or API gateway for applications running
on Kubernetes. NGINX Gateway Fabric supports a subset of the Gateway API.

For a list of supported Gateway API resources and features, see
the [Gateway API Compatibility](docs/gateway-api-compatibility.md) doc.

Learn about our [design principles](/docs/developer/design-principles.md) and [architecture](/docs/architecture.md).

## Getting Started

1. [Quick Start on a kind cluster](docs/running-on-kind.md).
2. [Install](docs/installation.md) NGINX Gateway Fabric.
3. [Build](docs/building-the-images.md) an NGINX Gateway Fabric container image from source or use a pre-built image
   available
   on [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pkgs/container/nginx-gateway-fabric).
4. Deploy various [examples](examples).
5. Read our [guides](/docs/guides).

## NGINX Gateway Fabric Releases

We publish NGINX Gateway Fabric releases on GitHub. See
our [releases page](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/releases).

The latest release is [1.0.0](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

The edge version is useful for experimenting with new features that are not yet published in a release. To use, choose
the *edge* version built from the [latest commit](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/commits/main)
from the main branch.

The table below summarizes the options regarding the images, manifests, documentation and examples and gives your links
to the correct versions:

| Version        | Description                              | Installation Manifests                                                                | Documentation and Examples                                                                                                                                                     |

### Versioning

NGF uses semantic versioning for its releases. For more information, see https://semver.org.

> Major version zero `(0.Y.Z)` is reserved for development, anything MAY change at any time. The public API is not stable.

### Release Planning and Development

The features that will go into the next release are reflected in the
corresponding [milestone](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/milestones). Refer to
the [Issue Lifecycle](ISSUE_LIFECYCLE.md) document for information on issue creation and assignment to releases.


## Technical Specifications

The following table lists the software versions NGINX Gateway Fabric supports.

| NGINX Gateway Fabric | Gateway API | Kubernetes | NGINX OSS |
|--------------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Edge                     | 0.8.1       | 1.23+      | 1.25.2    |
| 1.0.0                    | 0.8.1       | 1.23+      | 1.25.2    |

\*the installation manifests use the minor version of NGINX container image (e.g. 1.25) and the patch version is not
specified. This means that the latest available patch version is used.

## SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

We generate SBOMs for the binaries and the Docker image.

### Binaries

The SBOMs for the binaries are available in the releases page. The SBOMs are generated
using [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) and are available in SPDX format.

### Docker Images

The SBOM for the Docker image is available in
the [GitHub Container](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pkgs/container/nginx-gateway-fabric)
repository. The SBOM is generated using [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) and stored as an attestation in the
image manifest.

For example to retrieve the SBOM for `linux/amd64` and analyze it using [grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) you
can run the following command:

```shell
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric:edge --format '{{ json (index .SBOM "linux/amd64").SPDX }}' | grype
```
