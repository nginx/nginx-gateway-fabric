# NGINX Gateway Fabric

NGINX Gateway Fabric is an open-source project that provides an implementation of
the [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) using [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) as the data plane. The goal of
this project is to implement the core Gateway APIs -- `Gateway`, `GatewayClass`, `HTTPRoute`, `TCPRoute`, `TLSRoute`,
and `UDPRoute` -- to configure an HTTP or TCP/UDP load balancer, reverse-proxy, or API gateway for applications running
on Kubernetes. NGINX Gateway Fabric supports a subset of the Gateway API.

For a list of supported Gateway API resources and features, see
the [Gateway API Compatibility](docs/gateway-api-compatibility.md) doc.

Learn about our [design principles](/docs/developer/design-principles.md) and [architecture](/docs/architecture.md).

## Getting Started

1. [Quick Start on a kind cluster](docs/running-on-kind.md).
2. [Install](docs/installation.md) NGINX Gateway Fabric.
3. [Build](docs/building-the-images.md) an NGINX Gateway Fabric container image from source or use a pre-built image
   available
   on [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pkgs/container/nginx-gateway-fabric).
4. Deploy various [examples](examples).
5. Read our [guides](/docs/guides).

## NGINX Gateway Fabric Releases

We publish NGINX Gateway Fabric releases on GitHub. See
our [releases page](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/releases).

The latest release is [1.0.0](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

The edge version is useful for experimenting with new features that are not yet published in a release. To use, choose
the *edge* version built from the [latest commit](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/commits/main)
from the main branch.

The table below summarizes the options regarding the images, manifests, documentation and examples and gives your links
to the correct versions:

### Versioning

NGF uses semantic versioning for its releases. For more information, see https://semver.org.

> Major version zero `(0.Y.Z)` is reserved for development, anything MAY change at any time. The public API is not stable.

### Release Planning and Development

The features that will go into the next release are reflected in the
corresponding [milestone](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/milestones). Refer to
the [Issue Lifecycle](ISSUE_LIFECYCLE.md) document for information on issue creation and assignment to releases.


## Technical Specifications

The following table lists the software versions NGINX Gateway Fabric supports.

| NGINX Gateway Fabric | Gateway API | Kubernetes | NGINX OSS |
|----------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Edge                 | 1.0.0       | 1.23+      | 1.25.3    |
| 1.0.0                | 0.8.1       | 1.23+      | 1.25.2    |
| 0.6.0                | 0.8.0       | 1.23+      | 1.25.2    |
| 0.5.0                | 0.7.1       | 1.21+      | 1.25.x *  |
| 0.4.0                | 0.7.1       | 1.21+      | 1.25.x *  |
| 0.3.0                | 0.6.2       | 1.21+      | 1.23.x *  |
| 0.2.0                | 0.5.1       | 1.21+      | 1.21.x *  |
| 0.1.0                | 0.5.0       | 1.19+      | 1.21.3    |

\*the installation manifests use the minor version of NGINX container image (e.g. 1.25) and the patch version is not
specified. This means that the latest available patch version is used.

## SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

We generate SBOMs for the binaries and the Docker image.

### Binaries

The SBOMs for the binaries are available in the releases page. The SBOMs are generated
using [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) and are available in SPDX format.

### Docker Images

The SBOM for the Docker image is available in
the [GitHub Container](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pkgs/container/nginx-gateway-fabric)
repository. The SBOM is generated using [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) and stored as an attestation in the
image manifest.

For example to retrieve the SBOM for `linux/amd64` and analyze it using [grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) you
can run the following command:

```shell
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric:edge --format '{{ json (index .SBOM "linux/amd64").SPDX }}' | grype
```

## Terminology

Gateway API features has three [support levels](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/conformance/#2-support-levels):
Core, Extended and Implementation-specific. We use the following terms to describe the support status for each level and
resource field:

- *Supported*. The resource or field is fully supported.
- *Partially supported*. The resource or field is supported partially or with limitations. It will become fully
  supported in future releases.
- *Not supported*. The resource or field is not yet supported. It will become partially or fully supported in future
  releases.

> Note: it might be possible that NGINX Gateway Fabric will never support some resources
> and/or fields of the Gateway API. We will document these decisions on a case by case basis.
>
> NGINX Gateway Fabric doesn't support any features from the experimental release channel.

## Resources

Below we list the resources and the support status of their corresponding fields.

For a description of each field, visit
the [Gateway API documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/spec/).

### GatewayClass

> Support Levels:

### Gateway

### TLSRoute

> Status: Not supported.

### TCPRoute

> Status: Not supported.

### UDPRoute

> Status: Not supported.

### Custom Policies

> Status: Not supported.

Custom policies will be NGINX Gateway Fabric-specific CRDs that will allow supporting features like timeouts,
load-balancing methods, authentication, etc. - important data-plane features that are not part of the Gateway API spec.

While those CRDs are not part of the Gateway API, the mechanism of attaching them to Gateway API resources is part of
the Gateway API. See the [Policy Attachment doc](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/policy-attachment/).
