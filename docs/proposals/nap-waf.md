# Enhancement Proposal-3341: NGINX App Protect WAF Integration

- Issue: https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/issues/3341
- Status: Provisional

## Summary

This proposal describes the integration of NGINX App Protect (NAP) WAF v5 into NGINX Gateway Fabric (NGF) to provide comprehensive WAF protection at Gateway and Route levels while working within NAP v5's architectural constraints of multi-container deployment and pre-compiled policy requirements. The design uses Gateway API inherited policy attachment to provide flexible, hierarchical WAF protection.

## Goals

- Extend NginxProxy resource to enable NAP WAF for GatewayClass/Gateway with multi-container orchestration
- Design WafPolicy custom resource using inherited policy attachment for hierarchical WAF configuration
- Define deployment workflows that accommodate NAP v5's external policy compilation requirements
- Provide secure and automated policy distribution mechanisms from external sources
- Deliver enterprise-grade WAF capabilities through Kubernetes-native APIs with intuitive policy inheritance
- Maintain alignment with NGF's existing security and operational patterns
- Support configurable security logging for WAF events and policy violations
- Support both HTTPRoute and GRPCRoute protection

## Non-Goals

- Compiling or updating NAP WAF policies (handled by external NAP v5 tooling)
- Providing inline policy definition (not supported by NAP v5 architecture)
- Supporting NGINX OSS (NAP v5 does not require NGINX Plus, but OSS support is out of scope at this time)
- Real-time policy editing interfaces
- Policy version management system
- Persistent storage management for policy files

## Introduction

### NAP v5 Architectural Constraints

NGINX App Protect WAF v5 imposes specific architectural requirements that fundamentally shape this integration design:

- **Multi-container deployment**: Requires separate `waf-enforcer` and `waf-config-mgr` containers alongside the main NGINX container
- **Pre-compiled policies**: WAF policies must be compiled externally using NAP tooling before deployment (cannot be defined inline in Kubernetes resources)
- **Shared volume architecture**: Containers communicate through shared filesystem volumes rather than direct API calls
- **External storage requirement**: Compiled policy bundles must be distributed via external storage systems (S3, HTTP, MinIO)

### Design Philosophy

This proposal provides the best possible Kubernetes-native experience while respecting NAP v5 constraints, abstracting complexity from end users where possible while maintaining operational flexibility for enterprise environments. The design uses Gateway API's inherited policy attachment pattern to provide intuitive hierarchical security with the ability to override policies at more specific levels.

### Policy Attachment Strategy

The design uses **inherited policy attachment** following Gateway API best practices:

- **Gateway-level policies** provide default protection for all routes attached to the Gateway
- **Route-level policies** can override Gateway-level policies for specific routes requiring different protection
- **Policy precedence**: More specific policies (Route-level) override less specific policies (Gateway-level)
- **Automatic inheritance**: New routes automatically receive Gateway-level protection without explicit configuration

### Storage Architecture

The integration uses ephemeral volumes (emptyDir) for NAP v5's required shared storage, consistent with NGF's existing ReadOnlyRootFilesystem security pattern. This approach provides:

- **Security alignment**: No persistent state that could be compromised
- **Operational simplicity**: No persistent volume lifecycle management
- **Clean failure recovery**: Fresh volumes on pod restart with current policies
- **Immutable infrastructure**: Policy files cannot be modified at runtime

```

This architecture demonstrates the hierarchical policy attachment system where Gateway-level WafPolicies provide default protection that can be overridden by Route-level policies for granular control:

**External Policy Management (Blue):** Security teams develop WAF policies using NAP v5 JSON schema, compile them using NAP v5 compiler tools, and publish the compiled policy bundles to accessible storage locations (S3, HTTP servers, or MinIO).

**Control Plane (Purple):** The NGF Pod in the `nginx-gateway` namespace acts as the centralized control plane, watching for NginxProxy and WafPolicy resources across application namespaces, fetching compiled policies from external storage using appropriate authentication, and distributing policy configurations to NGINX Pods via secure gRPC connections.

**Data Plane (Green/Red):** When WAF is enabled through NginxProxy configuration, each Gateway deploys as a multi-container NGINX Pod containing the main NGINX container with NAP module, plus the required WAF Enforcer and WAF Config Manager containers. These containers communicate through shared ephemeral volumes rather than network calls, maintaining NAP v5's architectural requirements.

**Application Namespace Resources:** All user-facing resources (Gateway, HTTPRoute, GRPCRoute, WafPolicy, NginxProxy, and optional authentication Secret) reside in application namespaces for proper isolation and RBAC management. The Secret is only required when using fallback authentication methods for accessing external policy storage - native cloud authentication for accessing external policy storage (S3, Azure Blob, etc.) uses annotations on the NGF service account in the nginx-gateway namespace.

**Policy Attachment Flow (Orange):** WafPolicy resources use targetRefs to attach to Gateways or Routes. Gateway-level policies provide inherited protection for all attached HTTPRoutes and GRPCRoutes. Route-level policies can override Gateway-level policies for specific routes requiring different protection levels.

**Traffic Flow (Yellow/Gold):** Client traffic (HTTP, HTTPS, and gRPC) flows through the public load balancer endpoint to the WAF-protected NGINX container, where NAP v5 applies security policies before forwarding filtered traffic to backend applications.

**Policy Inheritance:** Gateway-level WafPolicies automatically protect all routes attached to the Gateway. Route-level WafPolicies can override Gateway policies with more specific protection. This design supports both broad default protection and granular security controls while maintaining operational simplicity.

The architecture demonstrates separation of concerns: external policy compilation and storage, centralized policy distribution with inheritance hierarchy, and distributed policy enforcement, while maintaining security through ephemeral storage and immutable infrastructure principles.

### Network Access Requirements

NGF requires outbound network access to fetch WAF policies from remote locations:

- **HTTPS/HTTP access** to policy storage endpoints (S3, Azure Blob, HTTP servers, etc.)
- **DNS resolution** for policy storage hostnames
- **Standard HTTP client behavior** including proxy environment variable support

**Operator Responsibilities:**

- Configure appropriate NetworkPolicies for NGF pod egress access
- Set up corporate proxy configuration via standard environment variables (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`)
- Ensure DNS resolution for policy storage endpoints
- Mount custom CA certificates if using private certificate authorities
- Configure service mesh policies for external traffic (if applicable)

**Note**: Network access configuration is environment-specific and handled through standard Kubernetes networking patterns rather than NGF-specific configuration options.

### Policy Development Workflow

Given NAP v5 constraints, users must follow this workflow:

1. **Policy Development**: Write WAF policies using NAP v5 JSON schema
2. **Log Profile Development**: Create custom logging profiles or use built-in profiles (log_all, log_blocked, etc.)
3. **Compilation**: Use NAP v5 compiler tools to create policy and logging profile bundles
4. **Distribution**: Publish compiled policies and log profiles to accessible storage (S3, HTTP)
5. **Configuration**: Create WafPolicy CR with targetRefs referencing Gateway or Routes and configuring security logging
6. **Automatic Application**: NGF fetches and applies policies when WafPolicy is created or updated, with automatic inheritance

**Note**: Policy enforcement mode and behavior are defined within the compiled NAP policy itself. Security logging profiles can be either built-in names or custom compiled bundles.

Example CI/CD integration for manual updates:

```bash
# Compile policy using NAP v5 tools (policy defines enforcement mode)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/policies nginx/nap-compiler:5.6.0 \
  compile --input /policies/app-policy.json --output /policies/compiled-policy.tgz

# Compile custom logging profile (optional - can use built-in profiles)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/policies nginx/nap-compiler:5.6.0 \
  compile --input /policies/custom-log-profile.json --output /policies/log-profile.tgz

# Generate checksums for integrity verification
sha256sum compiled-policy.tgz > compiled-policy.tgz.sha256
sha256sum log-profile.tgz > log-profile.tgz.sha256

# Publish to storage
aws s3 cp compiled-policy.tgz s3://company-policies/prod-policy-v$(date +%Y%m%d).tgz
aws s3 cp compiled-policy.tgz.sha256 s3://company-policies/prod-policy-v$(date +%Y%m%d).tgz.sha256
aws s3 cp log-profile.tgz s3://company-policies/logging/custom-log-profile.tgz
aws s3 cp log-profile.tgz.sha256 s3://company-policies/logging/custom-log-profile.tgz.sha256

# Manual update: Modify WafPolicy resource to reference new policy and logging
kubectl patch wafpolicy gateway-protection \
  --patch '{"spec":{"policySource":{"fileLocation":"s3://company-policies/prod-policy-v'$(date +%Y%m%d)'.tgz"}}}'
```

### Security Logging Configuration

The securityLogs section supports multiple logging configurations, each generating an `app_protect_security_log` directive:

**Built-in Log Profiles:**

- `log_all`: Log all requests (blocked and passed)
- `log_blocked`: Log only blocked requests
- `log_grpc_all`: Log all gRPC requests
- `log_grpc_blocked`: Log blocked gRPC requests
- `log_grpc_illegal`: Log illegal gRPC requests
- `log_illegal`: Log illegal requests

**Custom Log Profiles:**

- Reference compiled logging profile bundles from remote sources
- Same fetch and validation mechanisms as policy bundles
- Support for checksums and retry policies

**Destination Types:**

- `type: "Stderr"`: Output to container stderr
- `type: "File"`: Write to specified file path (must be mounted to host for waf-enforcer container access)
- `type: "Syslog"`: Send to syslog server via TCP (recommend local proxy for secure forwarding)

**Generated NGINX Configuration Examples:**

```nginx
# Built-in profile to stderr
app_protect_security_log log_all stderr;

# Custom profile to file
app_protect_security_log /shared_volume/custom-log-profile.tgz /var/log/app_protect/security.log;

# Built-in profile to syslog
app_protect_security_log log_blocked syslog:server=syslog-svc.default:514;
```

### Policy Fetch Failure Handling

In the cases where there are policy fetch failures:

**First-Time Policy Fetch Failure:**

- Route configuration is **not applied** - no WAF protection enabled
- Route remains unprotected until policy becomes available

**Policy Update Failure:**

- **Existing policy remains in effect** - no disruption to current protection
- WAF protection continues with the last successfully deployed policy

**Retry Behavior:**

- Configurable retry policy with exponential backoff
- No service disruption during retry attempts
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting

### Policy Inheritance and Precedence

The design supports hierarchical policy application with clear precedence rules:

**Inheritance Hierarchy:**

- Gateway-level WafPolicy ‚Üí HTTPRoute (inherited)
- Gateway-level WafPolicy ‚Üí GRPCRoute (inherited)

**Override Precedence (most specific wins):**

- Route-level WafPolicy > Gateway-level WafPolicy

**Conflict Resolution:**

- Multiple policies targeting the same resource at the same level = error/rejected
- More specific policy completely overrides less specific policy
- Clear status reporting indicates which policy is active for each route

### NGF Integration Architecture

The integration leverages NGF's existing architecture:

- **Single NGF Pod**: Centralized control plane in `nginx-gateway` namespace manages all WAF operations
- **Per-Gateway Deployment**: Each Gateway with WAF enabled gets a dedicated multi-container NGINX Pod
- **Selective WAF Enablement**: Only Gateways configured with WAF-enabled NginxProxy resources deploy NAP v5 containers
- **Centralized Policy Management**: NGF controllers fetch policies and distribute them to appropriate NGINX Pods via the existing Agent gRPC connection

## API, Customer Driven Interfaces, and User Experience

### NginxProxy Resource Extension

Users enable WAF through the NginxProxy resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.nginx.org/v1alpha2
kind: NginxProxy
metadata:
  name: nginx-proxy-waf
  namespace: nginx-gateway
spec:
  # WAF policy configuration (extensible design)
  waf:
    policy: "Enabled"  # "Enabled" | "Disabled"
    # configuration tweaks optional, e.g.:
#   kubernetes:
#     deployment:
#       # NGINX container with NAP module (will set to default if waf policy is "Enabled" but these values are not configured)
#       container:
#         image:
#           repository: private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/nginx-plus-waf
#           tag: "2.1.0"

#       # NAP v5 required containers (will set to defaults if waf policy is "Enabled" but these values are not configured)
#       wafContainers:
#         enforcer:
#           image:
#             repository: private-registry.nginx.com/nap/waf-enforcer
#             tag: "5.6.0"

#         configManager:
#           image:
#             repository: private-registry.nginx.com/nap/waf-config-mgr
#             tag: "5.6.0"
```

### WafPolicy Custom Resource with Policy Attachment

Due to NAP v5's pre-compilation requirement, policies must be referenced from external sources and use targetRefs for policy attachment:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.nginx.org/v1alpha1
kind: WafPolicy
metadata:
  name: gateway-protection-policy
  namespace: applications
spec:
  # Policy attachment - targets Gateway for inherited protection
  targetRefs:
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: secure-gateway
    namespace: applications

  # Policy source (required due to NAP v5 pre-compilation)
  policySource:
    fileLocation: "s3://ngf-waf-policies/production/gateway-policy-v1.2.3.tgz"
    authSecret:
      name: "policy-store-credentials"
    validation:
      methods: ["Checksum"]
      # Note: Policy content validation handled by NAP v5 components
      # We will support signature verification in the future

    # Retry configuration for policy fetch failures
    retryPolicy:
      attempts: 3
      backoff: "exponential"
      maxDelay: "5m"

    # Timeout for policy downloads
    timeout: "30s"

  # Security logging configuration for app_protect_security_log directives
  # Multiple log configurations are supported
  securityLogs:
  - name: "stderr-logging"
    # Built-in logging profile (validated against allowed values)
    logProfile: "log_all"  # log_all, log_blocked, log_grpc_all, log_grpc_blocked, log_grpc_illegal, log_illegal
    destination:
      type: "Stderr"

  - name: "file-logging"
    # Custom logging profile bundle (similar to policy bundle)
    # logProfile and logProfileBundle are mutually exclusive per security log configuration entry
    logProfileBundle:
      fileLocation: "s3://ngf-waf-policies/logging/custom-log-profile.tgz"
      authSecret:
        name: "policy-store-credentials"
      validation:
        methods: ["Checksum"]
      retryPolicy:
        attempts: 3
        backoff: "exponential"
        maxDelay: "5m"
      timeout: "30s"
    destination:
      type: "File"
      file:
        path: "/var/log/app_protect/security.log"
        # Note: check this folder is actually writeable.
        # Path must be on shared volume accessible to waf-enforcer container

  - name: "syslog-logging"
    logProfile: "log_blocked"
    destination:
      type: "Syslog"
      syslog:
        server: "syslog-svc.default:514"
        # Note: TCP transport, unsecured. Use local syslog proxy for secure forwarding

### Gateway and Route Resources

#### Gateway Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: secure-gateway
  namespace: applications
spec:
  gatewayClassName: nginx
  infrastructure:
    parametersRef:
      name: nginx-proxy-waf
      group: gateway.nginx.org
      kind: NginxProxy
  listeners:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
  - name: grpc
    port: 9090
    protocol: HTTP
    hostname: "grpc.example.com"
```

#### HTTPRoute Integration

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: protected-application
  namespace: applications
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: secure-gateway
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: "/api"
    backendRefs:
    - name: api-service
      port: 8080

---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: admin-route
  namespace: applications
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: secure-gateway
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: "/admin"
    backendRefs:
    - name: admin-service
      port: 8080
  # Uses admin-strict-policy WafPolicy override via targetRefs
```

#### GRPCRoute Integration

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: GRPCRoute
metadata:
  name: protected-grpc-service
  namespace: applications
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: secure-gateway
  hostnames:
  - "grpc.example.com"
  rules:
  - matches:
    - method:
        service: "user.UserService"
    backendRefs:
    - name: grpc-service
      port: 9000
  # WAF protection inherited from Gateway-level WafPolicy
```

### Authentication Methods

The policy fetcher supports multiple authentication methods with preference for cloud-native approaches:

**Priority Order:**

1. **Native Cloud Authentication (Recommended)**
2. **Kubernetes Secrets (Fallback)**
3. **No Authentication (Public endpoints)**

#### Native Cloud Authentication

For cloud-hosted policy storage, NGF automatically detects and uses native cloud authentication when available. Supported methods:

- AWS S3 with IAM Roles for Service Accounts
- Azure Workload Identity Implementation
- GCP Workload Identity Implementation

**AWS S3 with IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA):**

```yaml
# Cluster operator configures service account (no WafPolicy changes needed)
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: nginx-gateway-fabric
  namespace: nginx-gateway
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/NGFPolicyAccessRole"

# WafPolicy uses S3 without explicit credentials
# NGF service account in nginx-gateway namespace provides IRSA authentication
spec:
  policySource:
    fileLocation: "s3://company-waf-policies/policy.tgz"
    # No authSecret needed - uses IRSA automatically
```

##### Benefits of Native Cloud Authentication

- No long-lived credentials stored in Kubernetes secrets
- Automatic credential rotation handled by cloud provider
- Fine-grained permissions managed through cloud IAM
- Reduced operational overhead for credential management

#### Kubernetes Secrets (Fallback)

For environments without native cloud integration or non-cloud storage:

##### Secret Structure Design

To begin with, we will likely only support a limited number of HTTP authentication methods, such as HTTP Basic Auth and HTTP Bearer Token.

```yaml
# HTTP Basic Auth
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
data:
  type: aHR0cC1iYXNpYw==  # base64("http-basic")
  username: <base64>
  password: <base64>

---
# HTTP Bearer Token
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
data:
  type: aHR0cC1iZWFyZXI=  # base64("http-bearer")
  token: <base64>
```

## Use Cases

### Hierarchical WAF Protection

#### Gateway-Level Default Protection

```yaml
# Provides base WAF protection for all routes
apiVersion: gateway.nginx.org/v1alpha1
kind: WafPolicy
metadata:
  name: gateway-base-protection
  namespace: applications
spec:
  targetRefs:
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: main-gateway
  policySource:
    fileLocation: "s3://policies/base-protection.tgz"
```

**Result**: All HTTPRoutes and GRPCRoutes attached to `main-gateway` automatically inherit WAF protection.

#### Route-Level Override

```yaml
# Stricter protection for sensitive endpoints
apiVersion: gateway.nginx.org/v1alpha1
kind: WafPolicy
metadata:
  name: admin-strict-protection
  namespace: applications
spec:
  targetRefs:
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: admin-routes
  policySource:
    fileLocation: "s3://policies/strict-admin-protection.tgz"
```

**Result**: Admin routes get stricter protection while other routes continue using base protection.

### Enterprise Security Operations

- **SecOps teams** compile and manage WAF policies using existing NAP v5 tooling
- **CI/CD pipelines** automate policy compilation, testing, and distribution
- **Platform teams** deploy WAF-enabled gateways with inherited protection for all applications
- **Development teams** can override Gateway policies for specific routes when needed
- **Operations teams** benefit from simplified policy management with automatic inheritance

### Multi-Environment Deployment

- **Development**: Gateway-level monitoring mode with detailed logging for policy tuning
- **Staging**: WAF-enabled Gateway for comprehensive policy testing with route-specific overrides
- **Production**: Full enforcement with performance-optimized policy bundles and granular route policies

### Selective WAF Deployment

- **Mixed Environment**: Some Gateways with WAF protection, others without, all managed by single NGF control plane
- **Resource Optimization**: WAF containers only deployed where needed, reducing resource consumption
- **Independent Scaling**: Each Gateway's NGINX Pod scales independently based on traffic requirements
- **Flexible Protection**: Default Gateway protection with route-specific overrides as needed

### Air-Gapped Environments

- **In-cluster policy storage**: Deploy MinIO or HTTP server within cluster boundaries
- **Offline compilation**: Use NAP v5 tools in secure environments, upload bundles manually
- **No external dependencies**: Complete WAF functionality without internet access

Example air-gapped configuration:

```yaml
spec:
  policySource:
    fileLocation: "http://policy-server.nginx-system.svc.cluster.local/policies/prod-policy.tgz"
```

### Regulatory Compliance

- **Audit trails**: Complete policy version history and deployment tracking
- **Change control**: Formal approval processes for policy compilation and deployment
- **Immutable policies**: Compiled policy bundles provide tamper-proof security configurations
- **Policy inheritance tracking**: Clear visibility into which policies apply to which routes

## Testing

### Unit Testing

- **NginxProxy Extensions**: WAF enablement configuration parsing and validation
- **WafPolicy Controller**: CRUD operations, status management, and policy fetching logic
- **Policy Attachment Logic**: targetRefs validation and inheritance resolution
- **Multi-container Orchestration**: Container startup sequences and ephemeral volume management
- **Policy Validation**: Compiled policy bundle checksum integrity checking

### Integration Testing

- **Policy Inheritance**: Gateway-level policies applying to HTTPRoutes and GRPCRoutes
- **Policy Override**: Route-level policies overriding Gateway-level policies
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete policy compilation, distribution, and enforcement across multiple Gateway scenarios
- **NGF Control Plane**: Single NGF Pod managing multiple WAF-enabled and standard NGINX Pods
- **Policy Distribution**: Centralized policy fetching with distribution to appropriate NGINX Pods via gRPC
- **Multi-Container Pod**: NAP v5 container interaction via shared volumes in Gateway-specific NGINX Pods
- **Authentication**: Various credential types and failure handling for policy sources
- **Network Scenarios**: Policy fetching from different source types (S3, HTTP, in-cluster)
- **Selective Deployment**: Testing WAF enablement on subset of Gateways while others remain standard

### Performance Testing

- **Latency Impact**: Request processing overhead with NAP v5 enabled for HTTP and gRPC traffic
- **Throughput Analysis**: Concurrent request handling capacity with WAF protection
- **Resource Utilization**: Memory and CPU consumption of multi-container pods
- **Policy Size Impact**: Large compiled policy bundle handling and distribution timing
- **Scale Testing**: Multiple WafPolicy resources and policy updates under load
- **Ephemeral Volume Performance**: Volume I/O performance and sizing validation
- **Policy Inheritance Performance**: Impact of policy resolution on request processing
- Note: current NFR testing likely covers all of these scenarios, but we may want to add a separate NGINX Plus WAF run

### Conformance Testing

- **Gateway API Compatibility**: Ensure proper integration with Gateway API specifications
- **Policy Attachment Compliance**: Verify adherence to Gateway API policy attachment patterns
- **Kubernetes Resource Validation**: CRD schema validation
- **Security Policy Enforcement**: Verify attack blocking with known threat patterns for HTTP and gRPC (high level, we don't need to test granular WAF functionality, just that the integration works as expected)

## Security Considerations

### Policy Security

- **Integrity Verification**: Checksum validation of compiled policy bundles prevents tampering
- **Secure Transport**: TLS encryption for all policy downloads from external sources
- **Access Control**: RBAC restrictions on WafPolicy resource creation and modification

### Credential Management

- **Native Cloud Authentication**: Preferred method using cloud provider's Kubernetes integration (IRSA, Workload Identity, etc.)
- **Kubernetes Secrets**: Fallback method for environments without native cloud integration
- **Automatic Detection**: NGF automatically detects and uses the most appropriate authentication method
- **Credential Rotation**: Native cloud authentication provides automatic rotation; secret-based authentication supports manual rotation without service disruption
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal access requirements for policy fetching operations
- **No Long-Lived Credentials**: Native cloud authentication eliminates the need for storing long-lived credentials in cluster

### Runtime Security

- **Container Isolation**: Proper security contexts and resource boundaries for NAP v5 containers
- **Multi-Container Security**: Expanded attack surface managed through container privilege boundaries
- **Resource Limits**: Prevention of resource exhaustion through container resource constraints

### Storage Security

- **Ephemeral Storage**: Policy and configuration volumes use ephemeral storage, ensuring no persistent state that could be compromised and alignment with immutable infrastructure principles
- **ReadOnlyRootFilesystem**: Maintains existing NGF security pattern with no writable root filesystem
- **Volume Permissions**: Proper file permissions and access controls on shared volumes

### Policy Distribution Security

- **Transport Security**: TLS encryption and certificate validation for HTTPS policy sources
- **Policy Integrity**: Checksum verification prevents corrupted or tampered policy deployment
- **Authentication**: Support for cloud-native and secret-based authentication to policy sources

### Operator Security Requirements

- **Network Segmentation**: Operators must configure NetworkPolicies for controlled egress access
- **Source Authorization**: Operators responsible for ensuring policy sources are legitimate and approved
- **Access Logging**: Standard Kubernetes audit logging captures WafPolicy resource operations; policy fetch operations logged via NGF's existing logging mechanisms

## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Filter-Based Attachment

**Approach**: Use Gateway API filters instead of policy attachment
**Rejected Reason**: WAF is a cross-cutting security concern better suited to policy attachment; filters would require explicit configuration on every route and lack inheritance capabilities

### Alternative 2: Direct Policy Attachment Only

**Approach**: Support only direct policy attachment without inheritance
**Rejected Reason**: Would require explicit policy attachment to every route; inheritance provides better operational experience and matches typical WAF deployment patterns

### Alternative 3: Inline Policy Definition

**Approach**: Allow users to define WAF policies directly in Kubernetes YAML
**Rejected Reason**: NAP v5 requires pre-compiled policy bundles; inline definition not supported by underlying technology

### Alternative 4: NGF-Managed Policy Compilation

**Approach**: Build policy compilation capabilities into NGF controller
**Rejected Reason**: Would require embedding NAP v5 compiler toolchain in NGF, significantly increasing complexity and licensing requirements

### Alternative 5: Persistent Volume Storage

**Approach**: Use PersistentVolumeClaims for NAP v5 shared storage
**Rejected Reason**: Conflicts with NGF's existing ReadOnlyRootFilesystem pattern; ephemeral storage provides better security posture and operational simplicity

### Alternative 6: NGINX Direct Policy Fetching

**Approach**: Have NGINX containers fetch policies directly using njs
**Rejected Reason**: Creates distributed system complexity, inconsistent state issues, and violates NGF's centralized control plane pattern

## Future Enhancements

- **Policy signature verification**: Cryptographic validation of policy bundle authenticity using public key infrastructure
- **Advanced policy inheritance**: Support for policy merging and composition rather than simple override
