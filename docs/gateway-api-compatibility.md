## Terminology

Gateway API features has three [support levels](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/conformance/#2-support-levels):
Core, Extended and Implementation-specific. We use the following terms to describe the support status for each level and
resource field:

- *Supported*. The resource or field is fully supported.
- *Partially supported*. The resource or field is supported partially or with limitations. It will become fully
  supported in future releases.
- *Not supported*. The resource or field is not yet supported. It will become partially or fully supported in future
  releases.

> Note: it might be possible that NGINX Gateway Fabric will never support some resources
> and/or fields of the Gateway API. We will document these decisions on a case by case basis.
>
> NGINX Gateway Fabric doesn't support any features from the experimental release channel.

## Resources

Below we list the resources and the support status of their corresponding fields.

For a description of each field, visit
the [Gateway API documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/spec/).

### GatewayClass

> Support Levels:
>
> - Core: Supported.
> - Extended: Not supported.
> - Implementation-specific: Not supported.

NGINX Gateway Fabric supports only a single GatewayClass resource configured via `--gatewayclass` flag of
the [static-mode](./cli-help.md#static-mode) command.

Fields:

- `spec`
  - `controllerName` - supported.
  - `parametersRef` - not supported.

- `status`
  - `conditions` - supported (Condition/Status/Reason):
    - `Accepted/True/Accepted`
    - `Accepted/False/InvalidParameters`
    - `Accepted/False/GatewayClassConflict`: Custom reason for when the GatewayClass references this controller, but
          a different GatewayClass name is provided to the controller via the command-line argument.

### Gateway

> Support Levels:
>
> - Core: Supported.
> - Extended: Partially supported.
> - Implementation-specific: Not supported.

NGINX Gateway Fabric supports only a single Gateway resource. The Gateway resource must reference NGINX Gateway

          NGF only supports a single Gateway.
    - `Programmed/True/Programmed`
    - `Programmed/False/Invalid`
    - `Programmed/False/GatewayConflict`- custom reason for when the Gateway is ignored due to a conflicting
          Gateway. NGF only supports a single Gateway.

              not supported.
      - `Accepted/False/GatewayConflict` - custom reason for when the Gateway is ignored due to a conflicting
              Gateway. NGF only supports a single Gateway.
      - `Programmed/True/Programmed`
      - `Programmed/False/Invalid`

### HTTPRoute

> Support Levels:
>
> - Core: Supported.
> - Extended: Partially supported.
> - Implementation-specific: Not supported.

Fields:

- `spec`
  - `parentRefs` - partially supported. Port not supported.
  - `hostnames` - supported.
  - `rules`
    - `matches`

              rest.
      - `requestHeaderModifier` - supported. If multiple filters with `requestHeaderModifier` are configured,
              NGINX Gateway Fabric will choose the first one and ignore the rest.

      - `Accepted/False/NoMatchingParent`
      - `Accepted/False/NotAllowedByListeners`

              unsupported value.
      - `Accepted/False/InvalidListener` - custom reason for when the HTTPRoute references an invalid listener.
      - `Accepted/False/GatewayNotProgrammed` - custom reason for when the Gateway is not Programmed. HTTPRoute
              may be valid and configured, but will maintain this status as long as the Gateway is not Programmed.

### TLSRoute

> Status: Not supported.

### TCPRoute

> Status: Not supported.

### UDPRoute

> Status: Not supported.

### Custom Policies

> Status: Not supported.

Custom policies will be NGINX Gateway Fabric-specific CRDs that will allow supporting features like timeouts,
load-balancing methods, authentication, etc. - important data-plane features that are not part of the Gateway API spec.

While those CRDs are not part of the Gateway API, the mechanism of attaching them to Gateway API resources is part of
the Gateway API. See the [Policy Attachment doc](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/policy-attachment/).
