## Release 0.1.0

*August 22, 2022*

This is an initial release of NGINX Kubernetes Gateway project.

The release includes:

- A control plane agent (a Kubernetes controller) that updates date plane (NGINX) configuration based on the state of
  the resources in the cluster.
- Support for NGINX as a data plane.
- Kubernetes manifests for a Deployment with a single Pod with the control plane and data plane containers as well as
  Services to enable external connectivity to that Pod.
- Support for a subset of features of GatewayClass, Gateway and HTTPRoute resources (see the [Gateway API Compatibility doc](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-kubernetes-gateway/blob/v0.1.0/README.md)).

We expect that the architecture of NGINX Kubernetes Gateway -- the number of pods and containers and their
interaction -- will change as the project evolves.

NGINX Kubernetes Gateway is ready for experimental usage. We included
the [docs](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-kubernetes-gateway/tree/v0.1.0/docs) as well
as [examples](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-kubernetes-gateway/tree/v0.1.0/examples).

If you'd like to give us feedback or get involved, see
the [README](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-kubernetes-gateway) to learn how.

COMPATIBILITY:

- The Gateway API version: `0.5.0`
- NGINX version: `1.21.3`
- Kubernetes version: `1.19+`

CONTAINER IMAGES:

- Control plane: `ghcr.io/nginxinc/nginx-kubernetes-gateway:0.1.0`
