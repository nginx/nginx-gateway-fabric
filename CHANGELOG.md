## Release 2.1.2

_September 25, 2025_

BUG FIXES:

- Fixes a bug where the subscribe method was incorrectly intercepting initial configuration operations after a ServiceAccountToken rotation and signaling broadcast completion. [3905](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3905)
- Fixes an issue where a failed configuration reload caused all HTTPRoutes to be marked as invalid (Accepted: false). This led to external-dns removing DNS records even though the configuration had been rolled back. Routes now retain their valid state during reload failures, preventing unnecessary DNS disruptions. [3936](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3936)
- Adds NGINX image version validation during agent connections to prevent newer config being sent to pods running previous image versions during upgrades. [3928](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3928)

NGINX AGENT BUG FIXES:

- The NGINX Agent v3.3.1 update fixes connection reset issues during config apply by reusing existing connections, adds rollback on failures, and improves logging for more reliable configuration updates. [1261](https://github.com/nginx/agent/pull/1261)

BUG FIXES:

- Fix an issue where the NGINX Pod couldn't connect to control plane if multiple Pods shared the NGINX Pod's IP address. [3673](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3673)

DOCUMENTATION:

- Add simplified architecture diagrams for traffic flow and config changes. [3557](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3557)

HELM CHART:

UPGRADE:

- **Important:** Upgrading from v2.0.x to 2.1 requires the NGINX Gateway Fabric control plane to be uninstalled and then reinstalled to avoid any downtime to user traffic. CRDs do not need to be removed. The NGINX data plane deployment is not affected by this process, and traffic should still flow uninterrupted.

## Release 2.0.0

_June 5, 2025_

BREAKING CHANGES:

[How to upgrade to 2.0.0](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/install/upgrade-version/#upgrade-from-v1x-to-v2x).

The following changes are breaking and require users to fully uninstall NGINX Gateway Fabric (including NGINX Gateway Fabric CRDs) before re-installing the new version. Gateway API resources (such as Gateway, HTTPRoute, etc) are unaffected and can be left alone. [3318](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3318)

- Control plane and data plane have been separated into different Deployments. The control plane will provision an NGINX data plane Deployment and Service when a Gateway object is created.
- NginxProxy CRD resource is now namespace-scoped (was cluster-scoped).
- NginxProxy resource controls infrastructure fields for the NGINX Deployment and Service, such as replicas, loadBalancerIP, serviceType, etc. Users who want to set or update these fields must do so either at installation time through the helm chart (which sets them globally), or per Gateway. Updating these fields directly on a provisioned nginx Deployment or Service will not take effect. This does not apply to the the NGINX Gateway Fabric control plane Deployment.
- Helm values structure has changed slightly to better support the separate Deployments.
- `nginxGateway.replicaCount` Helm value has been renamed to `nginxGateway.replicas`.

FEATURES:

- Support for creating and deploying multiple Gateways. [3318](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3318)
- NginxProxy resource can now additionally be attached to a Gateway, and will overwrite any settings that are attached at the GatewayClass level, for the Gateway that it's attached to. [3318](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3318)
- Listener isolation supported for all routes. [3067](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3067)
- Allow configuration of NGINX Plus API access. [3066](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3066)
- Adds regex matching for headers and query params for HTTPRoutes and headers for GRPCRoutes. [3093](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3093)
- Add support for request mirroring using the RequestMirror filter. [3066](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3306)
- Adds support for Secrets to be used in BackendTLSPolicy for TLS certificates and CA certificates. [3084](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3084). Thanks to [porthorian](https://github.com/porthorian).

BUG FIXES:

- Fix an issue where default headers were still being set when overwritten by a user. [3249](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3249)
- Add 503 status code when there are zero upstream endpoints. [3406](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3406)
- Fixed bug that occurred when a route's ParentRef does not include a sectionName and the Gateway's listeners have duplicate hostnames. This would cause conflicts when the route tries to attach to all the listeners and falsely trigger validation checks around overlapping routes. [3418](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3418)

DOCUMENTATION:

- Migrated the documentation website into the [NGINX documentation repository](https://github.com/nginx/documentation). [3047](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3047)

HELM CHART:

- The version of the Helm chart is now 2.0.0
- Helm values structure has changed slightly to better support the separate Deployments.
- `nginxGateway.replicaCount` Helm value has been renamed to `nginxGateway.replicas`.
- Add support for control plane Deployment labels. [3194](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3194). Thanks to [Butterneck](https://github.com/Butterneck).

UPGRADE:

- [Upgrade to 2.0.0](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/install/upgrade-version/#upgrade-from-v1x-to-v2x)

KNOWN ISSUES:

- NGINX LoadBalancer Service IPFamily uses Kubernetes default (likely SingleStack IPv4) instead of matching the ipFamily set in the NginxProxy resource, which defaults to DualStack. [3473](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/issues/3473)

DEPENDENCIES:

- NGINX Plus was updated to R34. [3281](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/3281)

## Release 0.1.0

_August 22, 2022_

This is an initial release of NGINX Kubernetes Gateway project.

The release includes:

- A control plane agent (a Kubernetes controller) that updates date plane (NGINX) configuration based on the state of
  the resources in the cluster.
- Support for NGINX as a data plane.
- Kubernetes manifests for a Deployment with a single Pod with the control plane and data plane containers as well as
  Services to enable external connectivity to that Pod.
- Support for a subset of features of GatewayClass, Gateway and HTTPRoute resources (see the [Gateway API Compatibility doc](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/blob/v0.1.0/README.md)).

We expect that the architecture of NGINX Kubernetes Gateway -- the number of pods and containers and their
interaction -- will change as the project evolves.

NGINX Kubernetes Gateway is ready for experimental usage. We included
the [docs](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/tree/v0.1.0/docs) as well
as [examples](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/tree/v0.1.0/examples).

If you'd like to give us feedback or get involved, see
the [README](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric) to learn how.

COMPATIBILITY:

- Gateway API version: `0.5.0`
- NGINX version: `1.21.3`
- Kubernetes version: `1.19+`

CONTAINER IMAGES:

- Control plane: `ghcr.io/nginxinc/nginx-kubernetes-gateway:0.1.0`
