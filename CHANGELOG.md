- Generate default http server in NGINX if http listener exists in Gateway. [PR-320](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/320)

DEPENDENCIES:

- Bump sigs.k8s.io/gateway-api from 0.6.0 to 0.6.2. [PR-471](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/471)

COMPATIBILITY:

- Gateway API version: `0.6.2`
- NGINX version: `1.23.x` \*
- Kubernetes version: `1.21+`

\*the installation manifests use the `nginx:1.23` image, which always points to the latest version of 1.23.x releases.

## Release 0.2.0

_October 25, 2022_

This release extends the support of the features of the Gateway API resources.

FEATURES:

- Support the Pod IPs instead of the virtual IP of a Service in the NGINX upstream. Additionally, NGINX Gateway
  Fabric will pick up any changes to the Pod IPs and update the NGINX upstream
  accordingly. [PR-221](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/221)
- Support the redirect filter in an HTTPRoute rule. [PR-218](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/218)
- Support weights in backendRefs in the HTTPRoute (traffic splitting). [PR-261](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/261)
- Support the ObservedGeneration field in the HTTPRoute status. [PR-254](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/254)

BUG FIXES:

- Do not require the namespace in the `--gateway-ctlr-name` cli argument. [PR-235](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/235)
- Ensure NGINX Kubernetes Gateway exits gracefully during shutdown. [PR-250](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/250)
- Handle query param names in case-sensitive way. [PR-220](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/220)

DEPENDENCIES:

- Use the latest NGINX 1.23 image. [PR-275](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/275)
- Bump sigs.k8s.io/gateway-api from 0.5.0 to 0.5.1 [PR-251](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/pull/251)

COMPATIBILITY:

- Gateway API version: `0.5.1`
- NGINX version: `1.21.x` \*
- Kubernetes version: `1.21+`

\*the installation manifests use the `nginx:1.21` image, which always points to the latest version of 1.21.x releases.

## Release 0.1.0

_August 22, 2022_

This is an initial release of NGINX Kubernetes Gateway project.

The release includes:

- A control plane agent (a Kubernetes controller) that updates date plane (NGINX) configuration based on the state of
  the resources in the cluster.
- Support for NGINX as a data plane.
- Kubernetes manifests for a Deployment with a single Pod with the control plane and data plane containers as well as
  Services to enable external connectivity to that Pod.
- Support for a subset of features of GatewayClass, Gateway and HTTPRoute resources (see the [Gateway API Compatibility doc](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/blob/v0.1.0/README.md)).

We expect that the architecture of NGINX Kubernetes Gateway -- the number of pods and containers and their
interaction -- will change as the project evolves.

NGINX Kubernetes Gateway is ready for experimental usage. We included
the [docs](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/tree/v0.1.0/docs) as well
as [examples](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/tree/v0.1.0/examples).

If you'd like to give us feedback or get involved, see
the [README](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric) to learn how.

COMPATIBILITY:

- Gateway API version: `0.5.0`
- NGINX version: `1.21.3`
- Kubernetes version: `1.19+`

CONTAINER IMAGES:

- Control plane: `ghcr.io/nginxinc/nginx-kubernetes-gateway:0.1.0`
