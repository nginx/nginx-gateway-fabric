### Step 1 - Create a kind Cluster

```makefile
make create-kind-cluster
```

> Note: The default kind cluster deployed is the latest available version. You can specify a different version by
> defining the kind image to use through the KIND_IMAGE variable, e.g.

```makefile
make create-kind-cluster KIND_IMAGE=kindest/node:v1.27.3
```

### Step 2 - Install NGINX Gateway Fabric to configured kind cluster

> Note: If you want to run the latest conformance tests from the Gateway API `main` branch, set the following
> environment variable before deploying NGF:

```bash
 export GW_API_VERSION=main
```

> Otherwise, the latest stable version will be used by default.

#### *Option 1* Build and install NGINX Gateway Fabric from local to configured kind cluster

```makefile
make install-ngf-local-build
```

#### *Option 2* Install NGINX Gateway Fabric from local already built image to configured kind cluster

You can optionally skip the actual *build* step.

```makefile
make install-ngf-local-no-build
```

> Note:  If choosing this option, the following step *must* be completed manually *before* you build the image:

```makefile
make update-ngf-manifest PREFIX=<ngf_repo_name> TAG=<ngf_image_tag>
```

#### *Option 3* Install NGINX Gateway Fabric from edge to configured kind cluster

You can also skip the build NGF image step and prepare the environment to instead use the `edge` image

```makefile
make install-ngf-edge
```

### Step 3 - Build conformance test runner image

> Note: If you want to run the latest conformance tests from the Gateway API `main` branch, run the following
> make command to update the Go modules to `main`:

 ```makefile
 make update-go-modules
 ```

> You can also point to a specific fork/branch by running:

 ```bash
 go mod edit -replace=sigs.k8s.io/gateway-api=<your-fork>@<your-branch>
 go mod download
 go mod verify
 go mod tidy
 ```

> Otherwise, the latest stable version will be used by default.

```makefile
make build-test-runner-image
```

### Step 4 - Run Gateway conformance tests

```makefile
make run-conformance-tests
```

### Step 5 - Cleanup the conformance test fixtures and uninstall NGINX Gateway Fabric

```makefile
make cleanup-conformance-tests
```

```makefile
make uninstall-ngf
```

### Step 6 - Revert changes to Go modules

**Optional** Not required if you aren't running the `main` Gateway API tests.

```makefile
make reset-go-modules
```

### Step 7 - Delete kind cluster

```makefile
make delete-kind-cluster
```
