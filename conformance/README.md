### Step 1 - Create a kind Cluster

```makefile
make create-kind-cluster
```

### Step 2 - Install Nginx Kubernetes Gateway to configured kind cluster

> Note: If you want to run the latest conformance tests from the Gateway API `main` branch, set the following
> environment variable before deploying NKG:

```bash
 export GW_API_VERSION=main
```

> Otherwise, the latest stable version will be used by default.

#### *Option 1* Build and install Nginx Kubernetes Gateway from local to configured kind cluster

```makefile
make install-nkg-local-build
```

#### *Option 2* Install Nginx Kubernetes Gateway from local already built image to configured kind cluster

```makefile
make install-nkg-local-no-build
```

**Note:** You can optionally skip the actual *build* step. However, if choosing
this option, the following step *must* be completed manually *before* the build step:

- Set NKG_PREFIX=<nkg_repo_name> NKG_TAG=<nkg_image_tag> to preferred values.
- Navigate to `deploy/manifests` and update values in `deployment.yaml` as specified in below code-block.
- Save the changes.

 ```text
 .
 ..
 containers:
 - image: <nkg_repo_name>:<nkg_image_tag>
   imagePullPolicy: Never
 ..
 .
 ```

#### *Option 3* Install Nginx Kubernetes Gateway from edge to configured kind cluster
You can also skip the build NKG image step and prepare the environment to instead use the `edge` image

```makefile
make install-nkg-edge
```

### Step 3 - Build conformance test runner image

> Note: If you want to run the latest conformance tests from the Gateway API `main` branch, run the following
> make command to update the Go modules to `main`:

 ```makefile
 make update-go-modules
 ```

> You can also point to a specific fork/branch by running:

 ```bash
 go mod edit -replace=sigs.k8s.io/gateway-api=<your-fork>@<your-branch>
 go mod download
 go mod verify
 go mod tidy
 ```

> Otherwise, the latest stable version will be used by default.

```makefile
make build-test-runner-image
```

### Step 4 - Run Gateway conformance tests

```makefile
make run-conformance-tests
```

### Step 5 - Cleanup the conformance test fixtures and uninstall Nginx Kubernetes Gateway

```makefile
make cleanup-conformance-tests
```

```makefile
make uninstall-nkg
```

### Step 6 - Revert changes to Go modules
**Optional** Not required if you aren't running the `main` Gateway API tests.

```makefile
make reset-go-modules
```

### Step 7 - Revert changes to the NKG deployment manifest
**Optional** Not required if using `edge` image
**Warning**: `make undo-image-update` will hard reset changes to the deploy/manifests/deployment.yaml file!

```makefile
make undo-image-update
```

### Step 8 - Delete kind cluster

```makefile
make delete-kind-cluster
```
