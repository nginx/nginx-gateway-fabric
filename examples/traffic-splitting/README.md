# Example

In this example we will deploy NGINX Gateway Fabric and configure traffic splitting for a simple cafe application.
We will use HTTPRoute resources to split traffic between two versions of the application -- `coffee-v1`
and `coffee-v2`.


## Running the Example

## 1. Deploy NGINX Gateway Fabric

1. Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/installation/) to deploy NGINX Gateway Fabric.

1. Save the public IP address of NGINX Gateway Fabric into a shell variable:

   ```text
   GW_IP=XXX.YYY.ZZZ.III
   ```

1. Save the port of NGINX Gateway Fabric:

   ```text
   GW_PORT=<port number>
   ```

## 2. Deploy the Coffee Application

1. Create the Cafe Deployments and Services:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f cafe.yaml
   ```

1. Check that the Pods are running in the `default` Namespace:

   ```shell
   kubectl -n default get pods
   ```

   ```text
   NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   coffee-v1-7c57c576b-rfjsh    1/1     Running   0          21m
   coffee-v2-698f66dc46-vcb6r   1/1     Running   0          21m
   ```

## 3. Configure Routing

1. Create the Gateway:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f gateway.yaml
   ```

1. Create the HTTPRoute resources:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f cafe-route.yaml
   ```

This HTTPRoute resource defines a route for the path `/coffee` that sends 80% of the requests to `coffee-v1` and 20%
to `coffee-v2`. In this example, we use 80 and 20; however, the weights are calculated proportionally and do not need to
sum to 100. For example, the weights of 8 and 2, 16 and 4, or 32 and 8 all evaluate to the same relative proportions.

## 4. Test the Application

To access the application, we will use `curl` to send requests to `/coffee`:

```shell
curl --resolve cafe.example.com:$GW_PORT:$GW_IP http://cafe.example.com:$GW_PORT/coffee
```

80% of the responses will come from `coffee-v1`:

```text
Server address: 10.12.0.18:80
Server name: coffee-v1-7c57c576b-rfjsh
```

20% of the responses will come from `coffee-v2`:

```text
Server address: 10.12.0.19:80
Server name: coffee-v2-698f66dc46-vcb6r
```

### 5. Modify the Traffic Split Configuration

Let's shift more of the traffic to `coffee-v2`. To do this we will update the HTTPRoute resource and change the weight
of the `coffee-v2` backend to 80. Backends with equal weights will receive an equal share of traffic.

1. Apply the updated HTTPRoute resource:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f cafe-route-equal-weight.yaml
   ```

2. Test the application again:

   ```shell
   curl --resolve cafe.example.com:$GW_PORT:$GW_IP http://cafe.example.com:$GW_PORT/coffee
   ```

The responses will now be split evenly between `coffee-v1` and `coffee-v2`.

We can continue modifying the weights of the backends to shift more and more traffic to `coffee-v2`. If there's an issue
with `coffee-v2`, we can quickly shift traffic back to `coffee-v1`.
