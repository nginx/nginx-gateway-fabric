# HTTPS Termination Example

In this example, we expand on the simple [cafe-example](../cafe-example) by adding HTTPS termination to our routes and
an HTTPS redirect from port 80 to 443. We will also show how you can use a ReferenceGrant to permit your Gateway to
reference a Secret in a different Namespace.

## Running the Example

## 1. Deploy NGINX Gateway Fabric

1. Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/installation/) to deploy NGINX Gateway Fabric.

1. Save the public IP address of NGINX Gateway Fabric into a shell variable:

   ```text
   GW_IP=XXX.YYY.ZZZ.III
   ```

1. Save the ports of NGINX Gateway Fabric:

   ```text
   GW_HTTP_PORT=<http port number>
   GW_HTTPS_PORT=<https port number>
   ```

## 2. Deploy the Cafe Application

1. Create the coffee and the tea Deployments and Services:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f cafe.yaml
   ```

1. Check that the Pods are running in the `default` namespace:

   ```shell
   kubectl -n default get pods
   ```

   ```text
   NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   coffee-6f4b79b975-2sb28   1/1     Running   0          12s
   tea-6fb46d899f-fm7zr      1/1     Running   0          12s
   ```

## 3. Configure HTTPS Termination and Routing

1. Create the Namespace `certificate` and a Secret with a TLS certificate and key:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f certificate-ns-and-cafe-secret.yaml
   ```

   The TLS certificate and key in this Secret are used to terminate the TLS connections for the cafe application.
   > **Important**: This certificate and key are for demo purposes only.

1. Create the ReferenceGrant:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f reference-grant.yaml
   ```

   This ReferenceGrant allows all Gateways in the `default` namespace to reference the `cafe-secret` Secret in
   the `certificate` Namespace.

1. Create the Gateway resource:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f gateway.yaml
   ```

   This [Gateway](./gateway.yaml) configures:
    - `http` listener for HTTP traffic
    - `https` listener for HTTPS traffic. It terminates TLS connections using the `cafe-secret` we created in step 1.

1. Create the HTTPRoute resources:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f cafe-routes.yaml
   ```

   To configure HTTPS termination for our cafe application, we will bind our `coffee` and `tea` HTTPRoutes to
   the `https` listener in [cafe-routes.yaml](./cafe-routes.yaml) using
   the [`parentReference`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1.ParentReference)
   field:

   ```yaml
   parentRefs:
   - name: gateway
     sectionName: https
   ```

   To configure an HTTPS redirect from port 80 to 443, we will bind the special `cafe-tls-redirect` HTTPRoute with
   a [`HTTPRequestRedirectFilter`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1.HTTPRequestRedirectFilter)
   to the `http` listener:

   ```yaml
   parentRefs:
   - name: gateway
     sectionName: http
   ```

## 4. Test the Application

To access the application, we will use `curl` to send requests to the `coffee` and `tea` Services. First, we will access
the application over HTTP to test that the HTTPS redirect works. Then we will use HTTPS.

### 4.1 Test HTTPS Redirect

To test that NGINX sends an HTTPS redirect, we will send requests to the `coffee` and `tea` Services on HTTP port. We
will use curl's `--include` option to print the response headers (we are interested in the `Location` header).

To get a redirect for coffee:

```shell
curl --resolve cafe.example.com:$GW_HTTP_PORT:$GW_IP http://cafe.example.com:$GW_HTTP_PORT/coffee --include
```

```text
HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
...
Location: https://cafe.example.com/coffee
...
```

To get a redirect for tea:

```shell
curl --resolve cafe.example.com:$GW_HTTP_PORT:$GW_IP http://cafe.example.com:$GW_HTTP_PORT/tea --include
```

```text
HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
...
Location: https://cafe.example.com/tea
...
```

### 4.2 Access Coffee and Tea

Now we will access the application over HTTPS. Since our certificate is self-signed, we will use curl's `--insecure`
option to turn off certificate verification.

To get coffee:

```shell
curl --resolve cafe.example.com:$GW_HTTPS_PORT:$GW_IP https://cafe.example.com:$GW_HTTPS_PORT/coffee --insecure
```

```text
Server address: 10.12.0.18:80
Server name: coffee-7586895968-r26zn
```

To get tea:

```shell
curl --resolve cafe.example.com:$GW_HTTPS_PORT:$GW_IP https://cafe.example.com:$GW_HTTPS_PORT/tea --insecure
```

```text
Server address: 10.12.0.19:80
Server name: tea-7cd44fcb4d-xfw2x
```

### 4.3 Remove the ReferenceGrant

To restrict access to the `cafe-secret` in the `certificate` Namespace, we can delete the ReferenceGrant we created in
Step 3:

```shell
kubectl delete -f reference-grant.yaml
```

Now, if we try to access the application over HTTPS, we will get a connection refused error:

```shell
curl --resolve cafe.example.com:$GW_HTTPS_PORT:$GW_IP https://cafe.example.com:$GW_HTTPS_PORT/coffee --insecure -vvv
```

```text
...
curl: (7) Failed to connect to cafe.example.com port 443 after 0 ms: Connection refused
```


You can also check the conditions of the Gateway `https` Listener to verify the that the reference is not permitted:

```shell
 kubectl describe gateway gateway
```

```text
 Name:                    https
 Conditions:
