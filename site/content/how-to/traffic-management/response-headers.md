Learn how to modify the response headers of your application using NGINX Gateway Fabric.

## Overview

[HTTP Header Modifiers](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/http-header-modifier/?h=request#http-header-modifiers) can be used to add, modify or remove headers during the request-response lifecycle. The [ResponseHeaderModifier](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/http-header-modifier/#http-response-header-modifier) is used to alter headers in a response to the client.

In this guide we will modify the headers for HTTP responses when client requests are made. For an introduction to exposing your application, we recommend that you follow the [basic guide]({{< relref "/how-to/traffic-management/routing-traffic-to-your-app.md" >}}) first.

We'll begin by configuring an app with custom headers and a straightforward HTTPRoute. We'll then observe the server response in relation to header responses. Next, we'll delve into modifying some of those headers using an HTTPRoute with filters to modify *response* headers. Our aim will be to verify whether the server responds with the modified headers.

## Before you begin

- [Install]({{< relref "/installation/" >}}) NGINX Gateway Fabric.
- Save the public IP address and port of NGINX Gateway Fabric into shell variables:

   ```text
   GW_IP=XXX.YYY.ZZZ.III
   GW_PORT=<port number>
   ```

{{< note >}}In a production environment, you should have a DNS record for the external IP address that is exposed, and it should refer to the hostname that the gateway will forward for.{{< /note >}}

### Deploy the Headers application

Begin by deploying the example application `headers`. It is a simple application that adds response headers which we'll later tweak and customize.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/v1.4.0/examples/http-response-header-filter/headers.yaml
```

This will create the headers Service and a Deployment with one Pod. Run the following command to verify the resources were created:

```shell
kubectl get pods,svc
```

```text
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/headers-6f854c478-hd2jr   1/1     Running   0          95s

NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/headers      ClusterIP   10.96.15.12   <none>        80/TCP    95s
```

### Deploy the Gateway API Resources for the Header Application

The [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gateway/) resource is typically deployed by the [Cluster Operator](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/roles-and-personas/#roles-and-personas_1). This Gateway defines a single listener on port 80. Since no hostname is specified, this listener matches on all hostnames. To deploy the Gateway:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: nginx
  listeners:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
EOF
```

### Configure the basic HTTPRoute

Next, let's create a simple HTTPRoute that exposes the header application outside the cluster using the listener created in the previous section. To do this, create the following HTTPRoute:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: headers
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: gateway
    sectionName: http
  hostnames:
  - "cafe.example.com"
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /headers
    backendRefs:
    - name: headers
      port: 80
EOF
```

This HTTPRoute has a few important properties:

- The `parentRefs` references the Gateway resource that we created, and specifically defines the `http` listener to attach to, via the `sectionName` field.
- `cafe.example.com` is the hostname that is matched for all requests to the backends defined in this HTTPRoute.
- The `match` rule defines that all requests with the path prefix `/headers` are sent to the `headers` Service.

### Send traffic to the Headers application

We will use `curl` with the `-i` flag to access the application and include the response headers in the output:

```shell
curl -i --resolve cafe.example.com:$GW_PORT:$GW_IP http://cafe.example.com:$GW_PORT/headers
```

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.25.5
Date: Mon, 06 May 2024 19:08:39 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 2
Connection: keep-alive
X-Header-Unmodified: unmodified
X-Header-Add: add-to
X-Header-Set: overwrite
X-Header-Remove: remove

ok
```

In the output above, you can see that the headers application adds the following custom headers to the response:

- X-Header-Unmodified: unmodified
- X-Header-Add: add-to
- X-Header-Set: overwrite
- X-Header-Remove: remove

In the next section we will modify these headers by adding a ResponseHeaderModifier filter to the headers HTTPRoute.

### Update the HTTPRoute to modify the Response headers

Let's update the HTTPRoute by adding a `ResponseHeaderModifier` filter:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: headers
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: gateway
    sectionName: http
  hostnames:
  - "cafe.example.com"
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /headers
    filters:
    - type: ResponseHeaderModifier
      responseHeaderModifier:
        set:
        - name: X-Header-Set
          value: overwritten-value
        add:
        - name: X-Header-Add
          value: this-is-the-appended-value
        remove:
        - X-Header-Remove
    backendRefs:
    - name: headers
      port: 80
EOF
```

Notice that this HTTPRoute has a `ResponseHeaderModifier` filter defined for the path prefix `/headers`. This filter:

- Sets the value for the header `X-Header-Set` to `overwritten-value`.
- Adds the value `this-is-the-appended-value` to the header `X-Header-Add`.
- Removes `X-Header-Remove` header.


### Send traffic to the modified Headers application

We will send a curl request to the modified `headers` application and verify the response headers are modified.

```shell
curl -i --resolve cafe.example.com:$GW_PORT:$GW_IP http://cafe.example.com:$GW_PORT/headers
```

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.25.5
Date: Mon, 06 May 2024 17:58:33 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 2
Connection: keep-alive
X-Header-Unmodified: unmodified
X-Header-Add: add-to
X-Header-Add: this-is-the-appended-value
X-Header-Set: overwritten-value

ok
```

In the output above, you can see that the headers application modifies the following custom headers:

In the output above you can notice the modified response headers as the `X-Header-Unmodified` remains unchanged as we did not include it in the filter and `X-Header-Remove` header is absent. The header `X-Header-Add` gets appended with the new value and `X-Header-Set` gets overwritten to `overwritten-value` as defined in the *HttpRoute*.
