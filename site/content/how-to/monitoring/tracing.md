Learn how to configure tracing in NGINX Gateway Fabric.

## Overview

NGINX Gateway Fabric supports tracing using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). The official [NGINX OpenTelemetry Module](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-otel) instruments the NGINX data plane to export traces to a configured collector. Tracing data can be used with an OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) exporter, such as the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector). This collector can then export data to one or more upstream collectors like [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), [DataDog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/), and many others. This is called the [Agent model](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/deployment/agent/).

This guide explains how to enable tracing on HTTPRoutes using NGINX Gateway Fabric. It uses the OpenTelemetry Collector and Jaeger to process and collect the traces.

{{< important >}}
Tracing cannot be enabled for [HTTPRoute matches](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1.HTTPRouteMatch) with `headers`, `params`, or `method` matchers defined. It will be added in a future release.

## Install the Collectors

The first step is to install the collectors. NGINX Gateway Fabric will be configured to export to the OpenTelemetry Collector, which is configured to export to Jaeger. This model allows the visualization collector (Jaeger) to be swapped with something else, or to add more collectors without needing to reconfigure NGINX Gateway Fabric. It is also possible to configure NGINX Gateway Fabric to export directly to Jaeger.

Create the namespace:

```shell
kubectl create namespace tracing
```

Download the following files containing the configurations for the collectors:

- {{< download "otel-collector.yaml" "otel-collector.yaml" >}}
- {{< download "jaeger.yaml" "jaeger.yaml" >}}

{{< note >}}These collectors are for demonstration purposes and are not tuned for production use.{{< /note >}}

Then install them:

```shell
kubectl apply -f otel-collector.yaml -f jaeger.yaml -n tracing
```

Ensure the Pods are running:

```shell
kubectl -n tracing get pods
```

```text
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jaeger-8469f69b86-bfpk9          1/1     Running   0          9s
otel-collector-f786b7dfd-h2x9l   1/1     Running   0          9s
```

Once running, you can access the Jaeger dashboard by using port-forwarding in the background:

```shell
kubectl port-forward -n tracing svc/jaeger 16686:16686 &
```

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:16686](http://127.0.0.1:16686) to view the dashboard.

## Enable tracing

To enable tracing, you must configure two resources:

- `NginxProxy`: This resource contains global settings relating to the NGINX data plane. It is created and managed by the [cluster operator](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/roles-and-personas/), and is referenced in the `parametersRef` field of the GatewayClass. This resource can be created and linked when we install NGINX Gateway Fabric using its helm chart, or it can be added later. This guide installs the resource using the helm chart, but the resource can also be created for an existing deployment.

  The `NginxProxy` resource contains configuration for the collector, and applies to all Gateways and routes under the GatewayClass. It does not enable tracing, but is a prerequisite to the next piece of configuration.

- `ObservabilityPolicy`: This resource is a [Direct PolicyAttachment](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/policy-attachment/) that targets HTTPRoutes or GRPCRoutes. It is created by the [application developer](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/roles-and-personas/) and enables tracing for a specific route or routes. It requires the `NginxProxy` resource to exist in order to complete the tracing configuration.

For all the possible configuration options for these resources, see the [API reference]({{< relref "reference/api.md" >}}).

### Install NGINX Gateway Fabric with global tracing configuration

{{< note >}}Ensure that you [install the Gateway API resources]({{< relref "installation/installing-ngf/helm.md#installing-the-gateway-api-resources" >}}).{{< /note >}}

Referencing the previously deployed collector, create the following `values.yaml` file for installing NGINX Gateway Fabric:

```yaml
cat <<EOT > values.yaml
nginx:
  config:
    telemetry:
      exporter:
        endpoint: otel-collector.tracing.svc:4317
      spanAttributes:
      - key: cluster-attribute-key
        value: cluster-attribute-value
EOT
```

The span attribute will be added to all tracing spans.

To install:

```shell
helm install ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway -f values.yaml
```

You should see the following configuration:

```shell
kubectl get nginxproxies.gateway.nginx.org ngf-proxy-config -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.nginx.org/v1alpha1
kind: NginxProxy
metadata:
  name: ngf-proxy-config
spec:
  telemetry:
    exporter:
      endpoint: otel-collector.tracing.svc:4317
    spanAttributes:
    - key: cluster-attribute-key
      value: cluster-attribute-value
```

```shell
kubectl get gatewayclasses.gateway.networking.k8s.io nginx -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: GatewayClass
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  controllerName: gateway.nginx.org/nginx-gateway-controller
  parametersRef:
    group: gateway.nginx.org
    kind: NginxProxy
    name: ngf-proxy-config
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2024-05-22T15:18:35Z"
    message: GatewayClass is accepted
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Accepted
    status: "True"
    type: Accepted
  - lastTransitionTime: "2024-05-22T15:18:35Z"
    message: Gateway API CRD versions are supported
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: SupportedVersion
    status: "True"
    type: SupportedVersion
  - lastTransitionTime: "2024-05-22T15:18:35Z"
    message: parametersRef resource is resolved
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: ResolvedRefs
    status: "True"
    type: ResolvedRefs
```

If you already have NGINX Gateway Fabric installed, then you can create the `NginxProxy` resource and link it to the GatewayClass `parametersRef`:

```shell
kubectl edit gatewayclasses.gateway.networking.k8s.io nginx
```

Next, [Expose NGINX Gateway Fabric]({{< relref "installation/expose-nginx-gateway-fabric.md" >}}) and save the public IP address and port of NGINX Gateway Fabric into shell variables:

   ```text
   GW_IP=XXX.YYY.ZZZ.III
   GW_PORT=<port number>
   ```

You can now create the application, route, and tracing policy.

### Create the application and route

Create the basic **coffee** application:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: coffee
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: coffee
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: coffee
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: coffee
        image: nginxdemos/nginx-hello:plain-text
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: coffee
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    name: http
  selector:
    app: coffee
EOF
```

Create the Gateway resource and HTTPRoute for the application:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: cafe
spec:
  gatewayClassName: nginx
  listeners:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: coffee
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: cafe
  hostnames:
  - "cafe.example.com"
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /coffee
    backendRefs:
    - name: coffee
      port: 80
EOF
```

Check that traffic can flow to the application.

{{< note >}}If you have a DNS record allocated for `cafe.example.com`, you can send the request directly to that hostname, without needing to resolve.{{< /note >}}

```shell
curl --resolve cafe.example.com:$GW_PORT:$GW_IP http://cafe.example.com:$GW_PORT/coffee
```

You should receive a response from the coffee Pod.

```text
Server address: 10.244.0.69:8080
Server name: coffee-6b8b6d6486-k5w5w
URI: /coffee
```

You shouldn't see any information from the [Jaeger dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:16686) yet: you need to create the `ObservabilityPolicy`.

### Create the ObservabilityPolicy

To enable tracing for the coffee HTTPRoute, create the following policy:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.nginx.org/v1alpha1
kind: ObservabilityPolicy
metadata:
  name: coffee
spec:
  targetRefs:
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: coffee
  tracing:
    strategy: ratio
    ratio: 75
    spanAttributes:
    - key: coffee-key
      value: coffee-value
EOF
```

This policy attaches to the coffee HTTPRoute and enables ratio-based tracing, sampling 75% of requests. The span attribute is only included in the spans for the routes referenced in this policy.

Check the status of the policy:

```shell
kubectl describe observabilitypolicies.gateway.nginx.org coffee
```

```text
Status:
  Ancestors:
    Ancestor Ref:
      Group:      gateway.networking.k8s.io
      Kind:       HTTPRoute
      Name:       coffee
      Namespace:  default
    Conditions:
      Last Transition Time:  2024-05-23T18:13:03Z
      Message:               Policy is accepted
      Observed Generation:   1
      Reason:                Accepted
      Status:                True
      Type:                  Accepted
    Controller Name:         gateway.nginx.org/nginx-gateway-controller
```

The `message` field shows the policy is accepted. Run the next command multiple times to create new traffic.

```shell
curl --resolve cafe.example.com:$GW_PORT:$GW_IP http://cafe.example.com:$GW_PORT/coffee
```

Once complete, refresh the Jaeger dashboard. You should see a service entry called `ngf:default:cafe`, and a few traces. The default service name is `ngf:<gateway-namespace>:<gateway-name>`.

{{<img src="img/jaeger-trace-overview.png" alt="">}}

Select a trace to view the attributes.

{{<img src="img/jaeger-trace-attributes.png" alt="">}}

The trace includes the attribute from the global NginxProxy resource as well as the attribute from the ObservabilityPolicy.
