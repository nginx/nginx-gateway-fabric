## Overview

The NGINX Plus dashboard offers a real-time live activity monitoring interface that shows key load and performance metrics of your server infrastructure. The dashboard is enabled by default for NGINX Gateway Fabric deployments that use NGINX Plus as the data plane. The dashboard is available on port 8765.

To access the dashboard:

1. Use port-forwarding to forward connections to port 8765 on your local machine to port 8765 on the NGINX Gateway Fabric pod (replace `<nginx-gateway-fabric-pod>` with the actual name of the pod).

    ```shell
    kubectl port-forward <nginx-gateway-fabric-pod> 8765:8765 -n nginx-gateway
    ```

1. Open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8765/dashboard.html](http://127.0.0.1:8765/dashboard.html) to access the dashboard.

The dashboard will look like this:
