## Community Support

For NGINX Gateway Fabric support or issues not addressed by documentation, you can reach out using the following two options:

- Create an issue using the [Issues tab in the NGINX Gateway Fabric GitHub repo](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/issues).

    We use issues for bug reports and to discuss new features. Creating issues is good, creating good issues is even better. Filing meaningful bug reports with lots of information in them helps us figure out what to fix when and how it impacts our users. We like bugs because it means people are using our code, and we like fixing them even more.

    All issues should follow these guidelines:

    -Describe the problem. Include version of Kubernetes, NGINX Gateway Fabric version, and what Kubernetes platform.
    -Include detailed information about how to recreate the issue.
    -Include relevant configurations, error messages, and logs.
    -Sanitize the data. For example, be mindful of IPs, ports, application names, and URLs.
