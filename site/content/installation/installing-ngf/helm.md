## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you'll need to install:

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), a command-line tool for managing Kubernetes clusters.
- [Helm 3.0 or later](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), for deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes.
- If youâ€™d like to use NGINX Plus:
  1. To pull from the F5 Container registry, configure a docker registry secret using your JWT token from the MyF5 portal by following the instructions from [here]({{<relref "installation/ngf-images/jwt-token-docker-secret.md">}}). Make sure to specify the secret using `nginxGateway.serviceAccount.imagePullSecret` or `nginxGateway.serviceAccount.imagePullSecrets` parameter.
  1. Alternatively, pull an NGINX Gateway Fabric image with NGINX Plus and push it to your private registry by following the instructions from [here]({{<relref "installation/ngf-images/pulling-ngf-image.md">}}).
  1. Update the `nginxGateway.image.repository` field of the `values.yaml` accordingly.


## Deploy NGINX Gateway Fabric

### Installing the Gateway API resources


{{<include "installation/install-gateway-api-resources.md" >}}



### Install from the OCI registry

To install the latest stable release of NGINX Gateway Fabric in the **nginx-gateway** namespace, run the following command:

##### For NGINX

   ```shell
   helm install ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway
   ```

##### For NGINX Plus

  {{< note >}}Replace `private-registry.nginx.com` with the proper registry for your NGINX Plus image, and if applicable, replace `nginx-plus-registry-secret` with your Secret name containing the registry credentials.{{< /note >}}

  {{< important >}}Ensure that you [Enable Usage Reporting]({{< relref "installation/usage-reporting.md" >}}) when installing.{{< /important >}}

   ```shell
   helm install ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric  --set nginx.image.repository=private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/nginx-plus --set nginx.plus=true --set serviceAccount.imagePullSecret=nginx-plus-registry-secret --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway
   ```

   `ngf` is the name of the release, and can be changed to any name you want. This name is added as a prefix to the Deployment name.

   If the namespace already exists, you can omit the optional `--create-namespace` flag. If you want the latest version from the **main** branch, add `--version 0.0.0-edge` to your install command.

   You can also use the certificate and key from the MyF5 portal and the Docker registry API to list the available image tags for NGINX Plus, for example:

   ```shell
      $ curl https://private-registry.nginx.com/v2/nginx-gateway-fabric/nginx-plus/tags/list --key <path-to-client.key> --cert <path-to-client.cert> | jq

      {
      "name": "nginx-gateway-fabric/nginx-plus",
      "tags": ["edge"]
      }
   ```

   To wait for the Deployment to be ready, you can either add the `--wait` flag to the `helm install` command, or run the following after installing:

   ```shell
   kubectl wait --timeout=5m -n nginx-gateway deployment/ngf-nginx-gateway-fabric --for=condition=Available
   ```

### Install from sources {#install-from-sources}

1. {{<include "installation/helm/pulling-the-chart.md" >}}

2. To install the chart into the **nginx-gateway** namespace, run the following command.

   ```shell
   helm install ngf . --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway
   ```

   `ngf` is the name of the release, and can be changed to any name you want. This name is added as a prefix to the Deployment name.

   If the namespace already exists, you can omit the optional `--create-namespace` flag.

   To wait for the Deployment to be ready, you can either add the `--wait` flag to the `helm install` command, or run the following after installing:

   ```shell
   kubectl wait --timeout=5m -n nginx-gateway deployment/ngf-nginx-gateway-fabric --for=condition=Available
   ```

### Custom installation options

#### Service type

By default, the NGINX Gateway Fabric helm chart deploys a LoadBalancer Service.

To use a NodePort Service instead:

   ```shell
   helm install ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway --set service.type=NodePort
   ```

To disable the creation of a Service:

   ```shell
   helm install ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway --set service.create=false
   ```


#### Experimental features

We support a subset of the additional features provided by the Gateway API experimental channel. To enable the
experimental features of Gateway API which are supported by NGINX Gateway Fabric:

```shell
helm install ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway --set nginxGateway.gwAPIExperimentalFeatures.enable=true
```

{{<note>}}Requires the Gateway APIs installed from the experimental channel.{{</note>}}

## Upgrade NGINX Gateway Fabric

{{<tip>}}For guidance on zero downtime upgrades, see the [Delay Pod Termination](#configure-delayed-pod-termination-for-zero-downtime-upgrades) section below.{{</tip>}}

To upgrade NGINX Gateway Fabric and get the latest features and improvements, take the following steps:

### Upgrade Gateway resources

To upgrade your Gateway API resources, take the following steps:

- Verify the Gateway API resources are compatible with your NGINX Gateway Fabric version. Refer to the [Technical Specifications]({{< relref "reference/technical-specifications.md" >}}) for details.
- Review the [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for any important upgrade-specific information.
- To upgrade the Gateway API resources, run:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/standard-install.yaml
   ```

   or, if you installed the from the experimental channel:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/experimental-install.yaml
   ```

### Upgrade NGINX Gateway Fabric CRDs

Helm's upgrade process does not automatically upgrade the NGINX Gateway Fabric CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions).

To upgrade the CRDs, take the following steps:

1. {{<include "installation/helm/pulling-the-chart.md" >}}

2. Upgrade the CRDs:

      ```shell
      kubectl apply -f crds/
      ```

      {{<note>}}Ignore the following warning, as it is expected.{{</note>}}

      ``` text
      Warning: kubectl apply should be used on resource created by either kubectl create --save-config or kubectl apply.
      ```

### Upgrade NGINX Gateway Fabric release

#### Upgrade from the OCI registry

- To upgrade to the latest stable release of NGINX Gateway Fabric, run:

   ```shell
   helm upgrade ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric -n nginx-gateway
   ```

   If needed, replace `ngf` with your chosen release name.

#### Upgrade from sources

1. {{<include "installation/helm/pulling-the-chart.md" >}}

1. To upgrade, run: the following command:

   ```shell
   helm upgrade ngf . -n nginx-gateway
   ```

   If needed, replace `ngf` with your chosen release name.

## Delay pod termination for zero downtime upgrades {#configure-delayed-pod-termination-for-zero-downtime-upgrades}

{{< include "installation/delay-pod-termination/delay-pod-termination-overview.md" >}}

Follow these steps to configure delayed pod termination:

1. Open the `values.yaml` for editing.

1. **Add delayed shutdown hooks**:

   - In the `values.yaml` file, add `lifecycle: preStop` hooks to both the `nginx` and `nginx-gateway` container definitions. These hooks instruct the containers to delay their shutdown process, allowing time for connections to close gracefully. Update the `sleep` value to what works for your environment.

      ```yaml
       nginxGateway:
       <...>
       lifecycle:
           preStop:
           exec:
               command:
               - /usr/bin/gateway
               - sleep
               - --duration=40s # This flag is optional, the default is 30s

       nginx:
       <...>
       lifecycle:
           preStop:
           exec:
               command:
               - /bin/sleep
               - "40"
      ```

1. **Set the termination grace period**:

   - {{<include "installation/delay-pod-termination/termination-grace-period.md">}}

1. Save the changes.
