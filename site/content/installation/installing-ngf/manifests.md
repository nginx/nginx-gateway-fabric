## Overview

Learn how to install, upgrade, and uninstall NGINX Gateway Fabric using Kubernetes manifests.

{{< important >}} NGINX Plus users that are upgrading from version 1.4.0 to 1.5.x need to install an NGINX Plus JWT
Secret before upgrading. Follow the steps in the [Before you begin](#before-you-begin) section to create the Secret, which is referenced in the updated deployment manifest for the newest version. {{< /important >}}

## Before you begin

To complete this guide, you'll need to install:

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), a command-line interface for managing Kubernetes clusters.

{{< important >}} If youâ€™d like to use NGINX Plus, some additional setup is also required: {{</ important >}}

## Deploy NGINX Gateway Fabric

Deploying NGINX Gateway Fabric with Kubernetes manifests takes only a few steps. With manifests, you can configure your deployment exactly how you want. Manifests also make it easy to replicate deployments across environments or clusters, ensuring consistency.

### 1. Install the Gateway API resources

{{<include "installation/install-gateway-api-resources.md" >}}

### 2. Deploy the NGINX Gateway Fabric CRDs

#### Stable release

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/v1.5.1/deploy/crds.yaml
```

#### Edge version

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/main/deploy/crds.yaml
```

### 3. Deploy NGINX Gateway Fabric

{{< note >}} By default, NGINX Gateway Fabric is installed in the **nginx-gateway** namespace. You can deploy in another namespace by modifying the manifest files. {{< /note >}}

{{<tabs name="install-manifests">}}

{{%tab name="Default"%}}

Deploys NGINX Gateway Fabric with NGINX OSS.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/v1.5.1/deploy/default/deploy.yaml
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{%tab name="AWS NLB"%}}

NGINX Plus Docker registry, and the `imagePullSecretName` is the name of the Secret to use to pull the image.
The NGINX Plus JWT Secret used to run NGINX Plus is also specified in a volume mount and the `--usage-report-secret` parameter. These Secrets are created as part of the [Before you begin](#before-you-begin) section.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/v1.5.1/deploy/nginx-plus/deploy.yaml
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{%tab name="Experimental"%}}

Deploys NGINX Gateway Fabric with NGINX OSS and experimental features.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/v1.5.1/deploy/experimental/deploy.yaml
```

{{< note >}} Requires the Gateway APIs installed from the experimental channel. {{< /note >}}

{{% /tab %}}

{{%tab name="NGINX Plus Experimental"%}}

Deploys NGINX Gateway Fabric with NGINX Plus and experimental features. The image is pulled from the
NGINX Plus Docker registry, and the `imagePullSecretName` is the name of the Secret to use to pull the image.
The NGINX Plus JWT Secret used to run NGINX Plus is also specified in a volume mount and the `--usage-report-secret` parameter. These Secrets are created as part of the [Before you begin](#before-you-begin) section.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/v1.5.1/deploy/nginx-plus-experimental/deploy.yaml
```

{{< note >}} Requires the Gateway APIs installed from the experimental channel. {{< /note >}}

{{% /tab %}}

{{%tab name="NodePort"%}}

Deploys NGINX Gateway Fabric with NGINX OSS using a Service type of `NodePort`.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/v1.5.1/deploy/nodeport/deploy.yaml
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{%tab name="OpenShift"%}}

Deploys NGINX Gateway Fabric with NGINX OSS on OpenShift.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/v1.5.1/deploy/openshift/deploy.yaml
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{</tabs>}}

### 4. Verify the Deployment

To confirm that NGINX Gateway Fabric is running, check the pods in the `nginx-gateway` namespace:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n nginx-gateway
```

The output should look similar to this (note that the pod name will include a unique string):

```text
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-gateway-5d4f4c7db7-xk2kq   2/2     Running   0          112s
```

### 5. Access NGINX Gateway Fabric

## Upgrade NGINX Gateway Fabric

{{< important >}} NGINX Plus users that are upgrading from version 1.4.0 to 1.5.x need to install an NGINX Plus JWT
Secret before upgrading. Follow the steps in the [Before you begin](#before-you-begin) section to create the Secret, which is referenced in the updated deployment manifest for the newest version. {{< /important >}}

{{<tip>}}For guidance on zero downtime upgrades, see the [Delay Pod Termination](#configure-delayed-pod-termination-for-zero-downtime-upgrades) section below.{{</tip>}}

To upgrade NGINX Gateway Fabric and get the latest features and improvements, take the following steps:

1. **Upgrade Gateway API resources:**

   - Verify that your NGINX Gateway Fabric version is compatible with the Gateway API resources. Refer to the [Technical Specifications]({{< relref "reference/technical-specifications.md" >}}) for details.
   - Review the [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases) for any important upgrade-specific information.
   - To upgrade the Gateway API resources, run:

     ```shell
     kubectl kustomize "https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/config/crd/gateway-api/standard?ref=v1.5.1" | kubectl apply -f -
     ```

     or, if you installed the from the experimental channel:

     ```shell
     kubectl kustomize "https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/config/crd/gateway-api/experimental?ref=v1.5.1" | kubectl apply -f -
     ```

1. **Upgrade NGINX Gateway Fabric CRDs:**

   - To upgrade the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), run:

     ```shell
     kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/v1.5.1/deploy/crds.yaml
     ```

1. **Upgrade NGINX Gateway Fabric deployment:**

   Select the deployment manifest that matches your current deployment from the table above in the [Deploy NGINX Gateway Fabric](#3-deploy-nginx-gateway-fabric) section and apply it.

## Delay pod termination for zero downtime upgrades {#configure-delayed-pod-termination-for-zero-downtime-upgrades}

{{< include "installation/delay-pod-termination/delay-pod-termination-overview.md" >}}

Follow these steps to configure delayed pod termination:

1. Open the `deploy.yaml` for editing.

1. **Add delayed shutdown hooks**:

   - In the `deploy.yaml` file, add `lifecycle: preStop` hooks to both the `nginx` and `nginx-gateway` container definitions. These hooks instruct the containers to delay their shutdown process, allowing time for connections to close gracefully. Update the `sleep` value to what works for your environment.

     ```yaml
     <...>
     name: nginx-gateway
     <...>
     lifecycle:
       preStop:
         exec:
           command:
           - /usr/bin/gateway
           - sleep
           - --duration=40s # This flag is optional, the default is 30s
     <...>
     name: nginx
     <...>
     lifecycle:
       preStop:
         exec:
           command:
           - /bin/sleep
           - "40"
     <...>
     ```

1. **Set the termination grace period**:

   - {{<include "installation/delay-pod-termination/termination-grace-period.md">}}

1. Save the changes.

{{<see-also>}}
For additional information on configuring and understanding the behavior of containers and pods during their lifecycle, refer to the following Kubernetes documentation:

- [Container Lifecycle Hooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks)
- [Pod Lifecycle](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/Pods/Pod-lifecycle/#Pod-termination)
